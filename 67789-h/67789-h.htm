<small>THE RESCUE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>It was a rifle shot, sure enough, somewhere in the
hills, and Chris raised his huge head with a low growl
and thrust his nose against me in warning.</p>

<p>I was lying on the flat of my back, my hands
clasped under my head, thinking lazily, as I watched
the glorious sunset amid the Gravenje hills&mdash;where
the play of sunset colour is at times almost as fine
as in Colorado&mdash;and speculated when the storm
which was brewing would break.</p>

<p>I had just been chuckling at the idea of what the
men in Wall Street or the dandies of Fifth Avenue
would have thought of Chase F. Bergwyn, millionaire,
mine-owner, and financier, could they have seen
me then vagabondising in the Bosnian hills. My
dress was a kind of nondescript native costume, half
peasant&#8217;s, half miner&#8217;s, very dirty and worn with my
rough prospecting work; and I carried a ten days&#8217;
growth of scrubby beard on my sun-tanned face.
The report of the rifle stopped the chuckle on my
lips.</p>

<p>One of my men must have been after some hill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
game, I guessed, and in the eagerness of the chase
had disobeyed my strict orders against shooting. I
was anxious not to draw any unnecessary attention
to my doings. I was after another pile, in fact.
When in Vienna, just before, I had been offered what
appeared to be a good thing in the shape of a concession
to work a rich mining district in these Bosnian
hills, and, as I still had a touch of the vagabond
in me, I was roughing it in order that I might look
into the thing for myself.</p>

<p>I knew that part of Eastern Europe pretty well.
I had lived there as a lad with a relative stationed in
Prague, and as I had the knack of picking up the
Balkan languages, he had found me of such use that
he had taken me with him on many an expedition
among the hills in Bosnia, Servia, and Herzgovina.</p>

<p>I had delighted in the hills, and had carried my
love for them across the Atlantic when things
changed and I went to the States in search of fortune.
After a time of pretty hard rough-and-tumble hurly-burly
buffetting I had &#8220;struck it rich,&#8221; and turned
up in New York wealthy enough to play a strong
hand in the big gambles of Wall Street.</p>

<p>Then the wandering fever laid hold of me again,
and, remembering my days in the Balkans, I was
seized with the idea of utilising the old experiences
for business purposes. There was money to be made,
I believed; and I opened up communications with
folks in Belgrade and Sofia, and was in Vienna, on
my way to the Servian capital, when this Bosnian
mining affair turned up.</p>

<p>The pile was there right enough, just waiting for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
someone to come along and harvest it. But whether
the difficulties of harvesting it could be overcome, I
should have to settle elsewhere; and until they were
settled I didn&#8217;t wish to draw the inquisitive eyes of
any blockheads of Austrian officials upon me.</p>

<p>There were other dangers, too. Lalwor, a hill
village, was not far off, and the reports about the villagers
were not pleasing. They were not likely to
jump one&#8217;s claim, or do anything of that sort, but
were said to be quite ready to knock me on the head
if they had an inkling that I was a rich foreigner.
That at least was the opinion of the man who had
acted as my guide; and probably he knew.</p>

<p>So that, altogether, that shot annoyed me; and I
sat up, thinking no more about either New York or
the sunset, but just how to find out who had fired it,
and bent upon punishing him for disobedience. Not
so easy this last as it would have been, had I disliked
all the four men composing my party less and trusted
them more.</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p>Another shot. This time nearer.</p>

<p>Chris showed greater uneasiness than before, and
getting up ran forward sniffing the air. Almost immediately
afterwards I heard a faint throbbing sound
on the earth, uncommonly like a horse&#8217;s gallop. But
who could be galloping our way? No one who was
at all likely to be welcome; that was certain. I
scented trouble, and calling the dog back crouched
with him behind a bush-covered hillock and gazed,
not without some anxiety, up and down the steep,
rough mountain road.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>The camp&mdash;which consisted of a cottage or hut for
my use, a shed for the horses, and a tent for the men&mdash;lay
two or three hundred yards along a gully, which
branched off at right angles from this road. I
was lying at the mouth of the gully, and from my
position commanded a view from the top to the bottom
of the hill, about a mile in length.</p>

<p>Crack! crack!</p>

<p>Two more shots in quick succession; the throbbing
sound of the hoofs came nearer and nearer; and
a horse and rider showed at the top of the hill. I
caught my breath in surprise as I saw the rider was
a woman, who was urging her horse, a wiry little
white animal, to its utmost efforts as it dashed at
break-neck speed down the steep, winding, boulder-strewn,
dangerous road.</p>

<p>Next, two horsemen came into sight and, with a
loud shout, one of them reined up, and taking deliberate
aim fired at the fugitive woman. My eye was
on her as the shot rang out, and I saw the little white
beast start, and swerve as if hit. The next instant
the blood began to run freely over the flank, and the
horse&#8217;s gait told me it was badly wounded.</p>

<p>The men behind saw it, too; and the brute who had
fired the shot shouted to his companion, and then
continued the pursuit.</p>

<p>The chase was all but over. The white horse
struggled on gamely, but as it neared the gully where
I lay the pace slackened ominously. Its rider looked
back at her pursuers, and then across the ravine; and
then, to my further amazement, I saw that she was
no more than a girl in years&mdash;and a very pretty one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
too; her face flushed with the excitement of the mad
gallop, her eyes wide with alarm, and her features set
with the courage of desperate resolve.</p>

<p>Her pursuers realised her plight; and being now
sure of capturing her, slung their guns and rode down
the ugly path very cautiously.</p>

<p>I made ready to take my share in the business. I
had my revolver in my hip pocket, and drew it out,
but did not show myself. My intention was to let
her pass and then get between her and the men. But
her horse was done. The bullet had evidently found
the artery, for the blood was spurting out fast; and
just before she reached the spot where I crouched
the poor beast lurched badly and half sank on its
quarters. The rider had only time to jump cleverly
and quickly from the saddle when the end came, and
the gallant little horse rolled over.</p>

<p>She must have given up all for lost then; but she
showed no sign of faltering courage. One swift,
desperate glance round she gave, as if in search
of some chance of escape, and I saw her face
was pale and set, but full of determination. Then,
drawing a dainty little stiletto from her dress, she
stood at bay behind the body of the dying horse with
a calmness all eloquent of pluck and nerve.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with Chris at my heel, and keeping as
much as possible under cover, I crept forward until
I was opposite to her. The men dismounted when
they were still some fifty yards or so above her, and
they were rushing forward to close upon her when I
showed myself, with Chris growling ominously at my
side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>The surprise caused by my unexpected appearance
gave me a moment&#8217;s advantage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fear. The dog will guard you,&#8221; I called
to her as I passed. &#8220;Guard, Chris, guard, good
dog,&#8221; I told him; and instantly understanding me,
he ran to her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God,&#8221; I heard her murmur as I sprang
toward the men, with my revolver levelled at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may give it up,&#8221; I cried; but that was not
their view. One of them swung his gun round on
the instant, and was in the act of levelling it at me
when I fired, aiming low, and shot him in the leg,
bringing him to the ground.</p>

<p>His companion hesitated at this, then clubbed his
gun and appeared to be about to attack me, when he
suddenly changed his mind and made a dart for the
horses. I dashed after him, and as he vaulted into
the saddle I fired at his horse and wounded it. Uttering
a cry of rage, he leapt with extraordinary agility
to the unwounded horse, and might then have got
off had not the reins of both animals become entangled.
Before he could disengage them I had
closed up to him.</p>

<p>I called to him to surrender, but he had plenty of
fight in him, and, taking me no doubt for the peasant
I looked, he first struck at me furiously with his gun,
and then tried to ride me down.</p>

<p>I checked that effort with a bullet in his horse&#8217;s
head, however, and threatened to put one into the
man himself if he did not submit. But still he would
not.</p>

<p>Leaping free of the falling horse he surprised me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
by running back down the hill helter-skelter towards
the girl, who stood watching us with breathless interest.
I thought he meant to attack her, and, wild
with sudden anger, I rushed after him. He had apparently
remembered, however, that his comrade&#8217;s
gun was loaded and his object was to secure it.</p>

<p>But Chris stopped this. The weapon lay near the
girl and Chris sprang forward and snarled so savagely
looking so formidable and dangerous, that the man
hesitated, and before his hesitation was over I caught
up and closed with him. Over and over we rolled in
the dusty road in a fierce, hand-to-hand tussle, writhing,
kicking, and sprawling as we gripped each other
in that desperate wrestle. But I had the advantage
of method. I was Cumberland bred, and in my boyhood
had learnt some tricks and falls which had stood
me in good stead before now in many a &#8220;scrap&#8221; in
my rough-and-tumble mining days in Colorado and
Montana.</p>

<p>I got my grip of him presently, and bit by bit
moved my hands up till my fingers were playing on
his windpipe, and he was seeing stars as I dashed his
thick head again and again on the hard road, until
all the fight and all his senses too were knocked out
of him.</p>

<p>Then I rose, and taking the reins from the girl&#8217;s
horse, I tied him up securely with them.</p>

<p>All this time I had not spoken to her, except that
first sentence; but I had caught her great grey eyes
fixed upon me questioningly as she followed every
action. Before going to her I had a look at the man
I had shot, and found his leg was broken between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
knee and the ankle. I had some rough knowledge
of surgery&mdash;one picks up such things knocking about
the world as I had&mdash;so I probed about with my knife
and found the bullet, which was in the muscular calf,
cleansed the wound as best I could, and set the bone.
Then I placed him in as comfortable a position as I
could, and told him not to move until I could do
more.</p>

<p>This done, I rose and went to the girl. She was
now leaning against a boulder by the wayside, deathly
pale, and to my infinite concern I saw that her dress
was all blood-stained. One of the coward&#8217;s bullets
must have hit her, I thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you hit?&#8221; I asked. I spoke in Serb, as I
was more familiar with that than any other of the
Balkan languages.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It is the blood from this poor beast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God for that. You&#8217;re very pale, but you
won&#8217;t have any more trouble from the men. I&#8217;ll see
to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of replying she appeared in some way to
resent my tone of reassurance, and looked at me
steadily with this curious expression of resentment
mingled with gratitude and some fear. But she had
made friends with Chris, and the great fellow was
pushing his head against her as she stroked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were very brave,&#8221; I said after a pause, during
which I could not keep my eyes off her. She
was indeed a beautiful girl, with a figure of queenly
grace, and I daresay some of the intense admiration
I felt may have shown in my glance. I had never
seen so lovely a face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>&#8220;If that man is much hurt you had better see to
him,&#8221; she said, with a distinct note of command in
her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;His leg&#8217;s broken. I&#8217;m going to improvise a
splint, and then get help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Help?&#8221; Quick suspicion prompted the question.
&#8220;Do you live about here?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shut down a smile. She took me for a peasant;
and well she might, I thought, as I glanced down at
my clothes, dust-stained, torn, and dishevelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a cottage close here and a tent,&#8221; I
answered, evading her question and her glance.
There was clearly a mystery about her to be solved.
It was as evident as that she herself was well-born,
and accustomed to give orders for which she expected
prompt obedience. But leaving all explanations
over for the time, I set about making the splint.</p>

<p>Returning to the men&#8217;s horses I took off the bridle
and saddle of the dead one, cut away the saddle flaps,
and carried them and the reins to the injured man.
The flaps made good splints, and I bound them
tightly with the reins round his leg. He had borne
all my crude surgery work with such stoicism that I
guessed he was a Turk, and spoke to him in the little
Turkish I knew, telling him I would get help and
have him removed directly. He grunted something
about being all right, and soon was smoking as
placidly as though nothing had happened, and a
broken leg was one of the usual events of daily life.</p>

<p>I returned then to the girl, who was sitting on the
ground with her hands clasped over her face. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
guessed she was as desperately puzzled as I was what
to do next.</p>

<p>She sprang up quickly as I approached, and again
stared at me with much the same expression of
anxiety and doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem very clever and resourceful,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Can yet get me a horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for? To lose yourself in the darkness
among the hills?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can pay you&mdash;later, I mean. I have no money
on me. Tell me how to send it to you, and I will
give you any price you name. And I will add to it a
generous reward for what you have done already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think you are strong enough to travel
yet? You are still very white, and trembling like a
leaf. You are scarcely used to this sort of thing, you
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can judge that for myself,&#8221; she answered, almost
haughtily, making a great effort to rally her
shaken nerves.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you are. You don&#8217;t realise yet
how much this thing has shaken you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not accustomed to be contradicted in this
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very near contradicting yourself by
fainting,&#8221; I answered. I could see it plainly. &#8220;How
long have you been without food?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not wish you to question me. Can you get
me a horse, or must I try to walk? I must have a
horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another reason. If you know anything
of these hills you&#8217;ll know what a storm means among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
them; and there&#8217;s one brewing now. Listen.&#8221; As
I spoke we heard the rumbling of distant thunder
among the hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot stay here, in any case,&#8221; she shot back
quickly. Then, after a pause, &#8220;Who are you? Your
name, I mean?&#8221; This in her sharp imperious manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;My name is Bergwyn.&#8221; I slurred the pronunciation
intentionally. I had strong reasons for not
wishing anyone to know I had been on the hills on
my mission.</p>

<p>But the effect of the name upon her was remarkable;
and her agitation was too great to be concealed
even by the effort she made. She appeared completely
unnerved; and while her eyes opened wide in
unmistakable fear, she shrank from me as though I
were a pestilence incarnate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bourgwan&mdash;the&mdash;the brigand? I have heard
of you.&#8221; The words were just a whisper, uttered
with a catch of the breath all eloquent of terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I began with a smile intended
to reassure her; but before I could finish the sentence
her own unfortunate guess had completed her undoing,
and with a little gasping sob down she went
in a heap to the ground unconscious, to my utter
consternation.</p>

<p>Disconcerting as her collapse was, it nevertheless
had the result of deciding me what to do. Another
clap of thunder came at the moment; and, without
waiting to think any longer, I picked her up and set
off as quickly as I could along the ravine to the camp.</p>

<p>She had not recovered consciousness when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
reached the cottage; and as there was but one room
in it, I laid her on the bed, bundled my few things
together, tossed them out of sight, and leaving the
dog with her, I went over to the tent.</p>

<p>I found my four men asleep there, and waking
them with an impartial kick or two, sent them down
to bring up the prisoner and his wounded companion.</p>

<p>Then I began to realise what a really awkward
matter it was likely to be to have a girl, and such
a girl, quartered upon us. I was not by any means
sure of my own men, even. They had been chosen
by the guide; but even he had deemed them so worthless
and unreliable that he had gone off that morning
in search of others. Without him my position was
very grave. He was already a couple of hours overdue;
and with this storm coming up it was long odds
that he would not arrive until the next morning at the
earliest.</p>

<p>Still the thing had to be faced. I must take my
chance in the tent with the men that night, and trust
to my own authority and vigilance and wits.</p>

<p>I went back to the cottage, and was alarmed to find
the girl still unconscious; so I got some brandy, and
supporting her head managed to get a few drops
between her lips. This soon had an effect, and after
a repetition of the remedy she opened her eyes with
a deep, long-drawn sigh, and gave a great start as
she found me bending over her and herself on the
bed in the hut.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; I said, soothingly. &#8220;You fainted,
probably from exhaustion and the fright you had,
and I brought you here. It was the only thing I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
could do. You are perfectly safe, and the best thing
you can do is to be quiet until you can eat something.
As soon as you&#8217;re well enough I&#8217;ll find you a horse
and send you wherever you want to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>She listened very quietly, and smiled. A rare
thing, that smile of hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to feel you can trust me. I am not
that brigand, Bourgwan, or any other brigand, as
it happens; although my name is sufficiently like his
to cause you to make the mistake you did about it.
It&#8217;s all very rough here; but it&#8217;s the best we can do
for you. Now, do you think you can feel safe enough
to eat and drink something without believing we
mean to poison you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t.&#8221; It was only a whisper, but it was good
hearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had to give you a little brandy. Here&#8217;s
some more, if you&#8217;ll like it; and I can get you some
preserved milk and biscuits presently. Shall I leave
you alone here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The light had gone as the storm gathered; and just
as I spoke the storm burst right overhead with a
flare of lightning that filled the small room with lurid
light, followed by a deafening clap of thunder which
seemed almost to shake the earth until the hut
trembled.</p>

<p>But she showed no fear of the storm; so that I
gathered she was used to the violence with which
they raged in that district. She sat staring out of
the one narrow window wistfully and disconsolately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot go?&#8221; she said, making it almost a question.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>I threw the door wider open, and pointed to the
rain that was coming down in sheets&mdash;just like a
tropical downpour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite impossible&mdash;you can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose and looked out, shuddered, and then
went back to the bed with a sigh of disappointment.
Some moments passed then. The storm raged furiously:
the lightning flaring and flashing with intense
brilliance, filling the sordid little dingy room almost
continuously with its vivid blue light; the thunder
pealing and crashing and roaring as though the very
heavens would split; and the rain sweeping and swirling
down like a flood.</p>

<p>And within there was silence between us: she sitting
dead still on the low pallet, the dog haunched
by her side; and I standing, very ill at ease, near the
door, not knowing what to say or do next, and feeling
very much of an awkward fool. I wanted to
know that she trusted me, and would have given anything
for a word from her to show she did; while at
the same time I felt I would have bitten my tongue
out rather than have asked for such a word.</p>

<p>Yet out it came, nevertheless.</p>

<p>&#8220;You feel better and&mdash;and safe?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>The lightning showed me that she moved slightly,
turned her head and glanced toward me just for an
instant, but said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get you something to eat,&#8221; I murmured fatuously,
and went out and pelted through the rain to
the tent.</p>

<p>I had got some biscuits and a tin of milk, when a
thought occurred to me. The men had not returned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
and their guns piled in a corner of the tent
caught my eye as I was leaving. I made a bundle
of them and carried them away. I could trust my
men just as well if they had no firearms.</p>

<p>When I got back to the hut she was sitting on the
side of the bed and had quite shaken off the faintness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not have gone through the rain&mdash;but
I suppose you are used to it?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man in my position has to get used to anything.
Here are the biscuits and the milk. I&#8217;ve
some tinned meat in the cupboard here. Can you
eat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are those?&#8221; she cried, pointing to the
guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;The men&#8217;s guns. Best to keep them in the dry,
you see.&#8221; I spoke as indifferently as I could; but
she was very quick, and by the light of the storm I
saw her eyes upon my face, with a sharp, piercing
look.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not your reason. I hear it in your voice.
Is there anything more to fear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; It was a lie, of course, but I uttered it
stoutly, feeling the need of it. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll eat some of
this and get some strength back, I&#8217;ll explain the
position presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; she asked, starting and listening.</p>

<p>In an interval of the storm I heard the voices of
the men raised in high tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing, only the men with the prisoner,&#8221; I replied
calmly; but I didn&#8217;t understand the reason for
the high voices, and didn&#8217;t like it. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just go and
see them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go, please.&#8221; Half command, in the same
imperious tone I was getting to know well; but unmistakably
also half entreaty. It was the note I
had been waiting for so eagerly, and I felt myself go
hot with pleasure. She did trust me.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you wish,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;But I had better
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then she said, in a quiet
level tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;You must do as you think best, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chris here will answer for your safety. Try and
eat something,&#8221; I said; and with that I ran back again
to the tent.</p>

<p>In a moment I saw something was wrong. My
four men were clustered near the fellow whose leg I
had broken, quarrelling angrily, with many gestures;
while the man I had made prisoner was not in the
tent at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the other man?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>They all turned at the sound of my voice, and one
of them, with whom I had before had some bother,
took the question to himself. He shrugged his
broad shoulders, first scowled, and then laughed insolently.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s escaped,&#8221; he said, his tone a mixture of
doggedness and defiance.</p>

<p>The trouble I had been looking for had come, just
when it was most unwelcome.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />


<small>KARASCH.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I had had to deal with worse trouble than this
before, however, and to tackle far more dangerous
men than the fellow who, having sounded the first
note of rebellion, stood eyeing me with lowering
brows, while his fingers played round the haft of the
knife he carried.</p>

<p>These Eastern Europeans can be dangerous
enough in a crowd, or in the dark, or in any circumstances
which offer a chance of treachery. But they
don&#8217;t fight well alone or in the open. That&#8217;s where
they differ from the desperadoes of the West and the
mining camps; and I knew it.</p>

<p>The tent was a very large one, affording plenty of
room for a scrimmage, and as I walked straight up
to the man, keeping my eyes fixed on his, the rest
drew back a little. That&#8217;s another peculiarity of the
people of the hills. They will back up a companion
so long as the man in command is out of the way,
and then back down quite as promptly when the
music has to be faced.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, Karasch,&#8221; I said to the ringleader; &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want any more trouble with you&mdash;or with anyone
else; but I&#8217;m not taking any insolence from you.
Mind that, now. What do you mean by saying the
prisoner escaped?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Before he answered he glanced round at his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;He ran away,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tied him up so that he couldn&#8217;t run. Who set
him free? Whoever did that will answer to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Karasch did it,&#8221; answered one of the others.
Then I guessed the reason of the high words I had
heard, and that the speaker, whose name was Gartski,
had been against the thing in opposition to the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you do it, Karasch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I chose to; I&#8217;m no wench minder,&#8221; he
replied with an insolent laugh.</p>

<p>I did not hesitate a second, but while the laugh was
still on his lips I struck him full in the face as hard as
I could hit him, and down he went like a ninepin.
He scrambled up, cursing and swearing and spitting
out the blood from his mouth, and made ready to
rush at me with his long knife, when I covered him
with my revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put that knife down, Karasch,&#8221; I cried, sternly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t try any monkey tricks with me. And you
others, choose right now which side you&#8217;re on. I&#8217;ve
been looking for this trouble for a couple of days
past, and I&#8217;m quite ready for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gartski came to my side, and one of the others,
Petrov, drew to Karasch; the fourth, Andreas, remaining
undecided.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re faithful to me, Gartski?&#8221; I asked. My
guide had told me before that he was, so I felt certain
of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My life is yours,&#8221; he answered simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good; then we&#8217;ll soon settle this. Wait, Karasch.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
There isn&#8217;t room for two leaders in this camp,
and we&#8217;ll settle this between us&mdash;you and I alone&mdash;once
for all.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took Gartski&#8217;s knife and handed him my revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;If anyone tries to interfere in the quarrel, shoot
him, Gartski,&#8221; I said, and knife in hand I turned to
the others. &#8220;Now, Karasch, if you&#8217;re man enough,
we&#8217;ll fight on equal terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said the other two. It was a proposition
fair enough to please them all, particularly as his supporters
believed Karasch could account for me pretty
easily in such a fight.</p>

<p>He was quite ready for the tussle, and we began
at once. The tent was so gloomy&mdash;we had only the
dim light from a couple of lanterns&mdash;that it was with
some difficulty I could keep track of his eyes as he
crouched down and moved stealthily around, watching
his opportunity to catch me at a disadvantage
for his spring, his long ugly knife reflecting a gleam
now from one and now from the other of the lanterns
as he moved.</p>

<p>The storm was still raging furiously, and now and
again a lurid glare of the lightning would light up
the tent for an instant so vividly that the place seemed
almost dark by contrast the next moment.</p>

<p>The men drew to one side watching us, and the
wounded prisoner, stoic as he had shown himself in
his pain, propped himself up on one arm and followed
the fight with close interest.</p>

<p>My antagonist&#8217;s fighting was in the approved cat-like
method. Crouching low, he would move, with
lithe, stealthy tread, for a step or two, then pause,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
then spring suddenly in a feinted attack, then as
quickly recover himself, and begin all over again.</p>

<p>Fortunately I was no novice at the game; but I
had learnt the thing in another school. A Mexican
had taught me&mdash;an adept with the knife, with half a
score of lives to the credit of his skill. I stood all
the time quite still; every nerve at tension, every
muscle ready for the spring when the moment came,
but wasting no strength in useless feints. The less
you do before the moment comes, the more you can
do when it does come.</p>

<p>Never for an instant did my eyes stray from his;
noting every change of expression; watching every
movement, step, and gesture; almost every breath he
drew; and using every second to find the weak spot
in his attack.</p>

<p>I soon saw his purpose. He was striving to make
me give ground and drive me back to where I should
have no elbow room for free movement. But I did
not yield an inch, not even when he sprang so near
me in one of his feints as to make me think he meant
business at last.</p>

<p>Instead of giving ground I began to take it.
Twice he made as if to rush at me and each time as
he leapt back I stepped a pace forward. As the tent
was too small to admit of his circling me, he saw that
he was losing ground; and I noticed a shadow of
uneasiness come creeping to his eyes.</p>

<p>Then I saw my plan, and the real shrewdness of
the Mexican&#8217;s tactics. My opponent&#8217;s method had
a serious flaw. During the moment that he was recovering
himself after his feints he was incapable of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
attack, and if I could close with him at one of those
moments I should have him at an immense disadvantage.</p>

<p>With this thought I drew him on. When his next
feinting spring came I fell back a pace, and I could
tell by the renewed light in his eyes that he felt reassured
and confident. He had made me give way,
apparently, and felt he could easily drive me back
until he would have me at his mercy.</p>

<p>The next time I repeated the man&#339;uvre, and then
a grim grin of triumph lighted his face. He crouched
again and moved about me, stalking me to drive me
into an awkward corner of the place, his eyes gleaming
the while with fierce confidence and murderous
intent.</p>

<p>Inspired by this over-confidence, he sprang at me
again, this time too far, calculating that I should
again give way. But I did not, and as he jumped
back hurriedly to retrieve the mistake I closed on
him, caught his right wrist with my left hand, and
pressed him back, chest to chest, holding my right
hand away from his left which groped frantically and
desperately to clutch it.</p>

<p>In that kind of tussle he was no match for me. I
had all a trained wrestler&#8217;s tricks with my legs, and
tripped him in a moment so that he went down with
his left arm under him. I heard the bone snap as
we fell and I tore the knife from his grip.</p>

<p>His life was mine by all the laws of combat in that
wild district, and for a moment I held my weapon
poised ready to strike home to his heart.</p>

<p>To do him justice he neither quailed, nor uttered a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
sound. If he had shown a sign of weakness I think
I should have finished the thing as I was fairly entitled
to, and have killed him. But he was a brave
fellow, so I spared him and got up and turned to the
rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do either of you dispute my leadership?&#8221; I said
to the others. But they had had their lesson, and
had apparently learnt it thoroughly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Karasch&#8217;s doing, and his only,&#8221; said Petrov,
who had formerly taken sides against me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up, Karasch,&#8221; I said, in a short sharp tone.
He got up, and I saw his left arm was dangling uselessly
at his side. &#8220;Now tell me why you set that
prisoner free?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can fight. Your muscles are like iron. I&#8217;ll
serve a man who can fight as you can,&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a bargain,&#8221; said I. &#8220;Here;&#8221; and I held
out my hand. He looked at me in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the living God,&#8221; he muttered, as he put his
hand slowly into mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your knife,&#8221; I said next, returning it to
him.</p>

<p>He drew back, his surprise greater even than
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;You trust it to me?&#8221; He took it in the same
slow hesitating manner; and then with a quick
change of manner he set his heel on it and with a
fierce and savage tug at the haft, he broke the bright
blade in two.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been raised against you; and I&#8217;m your man
now and for always,&#8221; and down he went on one knee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
and seizing my hand kissed it, and then laid it on his
head.</p>

<p>Demonstrative folk these rough wild hill men of
Eastern Europe, and I knew the significance of this
act of personal homage.</p>

<p>So did the others who had watched this quaint
result of the fight with the same breathless interest
as they had followed the fight itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you serve me well you&#8217;ll find I can pay better
than I can fight, Karasch,&#8221; I said, as he rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not serving for pay now,&#8221; he replied simply.
&#8220;I serve you. My life is yours. Gartski, go and
saddle a couple of the horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and find the prisoner. He can&#8217;t have ridden
far in this storm; and I know his road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But your arm is broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can tie it up while he gets the horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me why you set him free, Karasch,&#8221; I said,
as Gartski and Andreas went out. &#8220;And while you
talk I&#8217;ll see to your arm.&#8221; I examined it, and found
the fracture in the upper arm; and having set it as
best I could I dressed it and bound it up while he
spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;On account of the woman,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know
the man, and he told me about her. She&#8217;s a witch
and a thief and worse, and comes from Belgrade.
She murdered a child, and was being sent to Maglai,
in the hills, to be imprisoned; and this morning cast
a spell over the men who were taking her and
escaped. They were to have a big sum of money if
they got her safe to Maglai, and the man promised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
me a share of it if I&#8217;d let him go back and bring his
friends here to retake her. I have no mercy for a
witch. God curse them all;&#8221; and he crossed himself
earnestly and spat on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is no witch, Karasch, but just a girl in a
plight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A witch can look just as she pleases. You don&#8217;t
know them, Burgwan&#8221;&mdash;this was how they pronounced
my name. &#8220;She was an old woman when
she left Belgrade. My friend told me that; and she&#8217;s
been growing younger every hour. She&#8217;s known to
be a hundred years old at least. She&#8217;s cast her spell
over you.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was true enough; although not in the sense
he meant. He was so obviously in earnest that I
saw it was useless to attempt to argue him out of his
superstition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, witch or no witch, spell or no spell, I am
going to see her into safety,&#8221; I answered firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll live to rue it, Burgwan. If I help you, it&#8217;s
because I serve you; not to serve her, God&#8217;s curse on
her;&#8221; and he crossed himself again and spat again,
as he always did when he spoke of her. &#8220;If you
want to be safe from her spells and the devil, her
master, you&#8217;d better twist her neck at midnight and
lop off her hands. It&#8217;s the only way to break the
spell when once cast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, I&#8217;ll try and find another way. And I&#8217;ll
take all the risks. Was that what you were all
wrangling about when I came in the hut just now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. She&#8217;s done harm enough, already. That
man&#8217;s broken leg, three good horses killed, and now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
my arm;&#8221; and he cursed her again bitterly. &#8220;It&#8217;ll
be you next,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll not be my arm that she breaks,&#8221; was my
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;What he says is true,&#8221; interposed the man whom
I had shot. &#8220;She&#8217;s a witch and a devil. Else how
did she know when to escape and how to ride here to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer that, Burgwan,&#8221; said Karasch, confidently.
&#8220;How could she know, if she weren&#8217;t a
witch?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gartski came in then to say the horses were ready,
and his entrance made any reply unnecessary, for
Karasch rose at once, went out and mounted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bring him back,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I know I can find
him unless that devil blinds the track.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should she do that, as it&#8217;s for her own advantage?&#8221;
I asked; but he and Andreas were already
moving off, and his answer was lost in the night air.</p>

<p>The storm had passed and the rain ceased, and as
I watched the two men ride off, the moon came out
from behind the clouds, so that I could follow the
horses for some distance down the ravine. As soon
as they had passed out of sight I turned to the hut.</p>

<p>I did not enter, but stood near the little window
and leant against the wall thinking. The tale I had
heard concerning the girl had made me very thoughtful.
Those who know anything of the ignorant
superstition of the peasantry of the Balkans will best
appreciate the danger to her of that grim reputation.
I had heard scores of stories of men and women who
had been done to death with merciless barbarity for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
witchcraft. The mere charge itself was enough to
turn from them any chance of fair trial and justice:
and I knew there was not one of the men with me
who would not have thought he was doing a Christian
act to strangle her. To kill her was to aim a
blow at the devil: the accepted duty of every God-fearing
man and woman.</p>

<p>But it was not so much her danger that set me
thinking then as the reason which must lie behind
the accusation. Who could have been devilish
enough to set such a brand upon her; and why? Did
she know her reputation? There must have been
some black work somewhere to account for the plight
to which such a girl had thus been reduced.</p>

<p>High-born and gently nurtured she certainly was;
accustomed to command and to be obeyed, as she
had given abundant proofs; endowed with beauty
and grace far beyond the average of her sex; and
with innocence and purity stamped on every feature
and manifesting itself in every act! Great enough
to have powerful enemies, probably, I guessed; and
in that I looked to find the key to the problem.</p>

<p>I was in the midst of these somewhat rambling
thoughts when the casement was pushed open gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it you, Burgwan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing there?&#8221; I was beginning
to listen now for the little note of command in her
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am on watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have turned you from your cottage.&#8221; This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
was half apologetic: followed directly by the other
tone. &#8220;You will be well paid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; It was no use protesting. It
seemed to please her to feel that she could repay me
for any trouble; and it did no harm to humour her.</p>

<p>&#8220;The storm is over. Can we not start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where would you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated. &#8220;I wish to get to the railway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To go where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not question me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon. I am not questioning you
in the sense you imply. There are two lines of railway
about the same distance away. One leads to
Serajevo, the other to Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The former perhaps twenty miles; the other I
don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>She caught her breath at this. &#8220;Where am I,
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the middle of the Gravenje hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God have mercy on me.&#8221; It was only a whisper;
but so eloquent of despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not despair. It is as easy to travel
forty miles as thirty; and twenty are not much worse
than ten. I will see you through.&#8221; But this touched
her dignity again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall be well paid,&#8221; she repeated. I let it
pass, and there came a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we not start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not told me for which railway; but it
doesn&#8217;t matter, as we cannot start to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; The imperative mood again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;My guide is not here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your guide?&#8221; Suspicion and incredulity now.
&#8220;Do you mean to say you don&#8217;t know your own
country? Do you expect me to believe that? It is
a mere excuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you found me deceive you yet in anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There may have been no cause yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it not be more just to wait until you do find
cause then?&#8221;</p>

<p>Another pause followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to anger you,&#8221; she said, with a
touch of nervousness; and as if to correct the impression,
she added: &#8220;Perhaps you do not think I can
keep my promise to pay you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may disbelieve me, but I don&#8217;t disbelieve
you. I have told you no more than the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why do you need a guide?&#8221; she asked after
a moment&#8217;s thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I don&#8217;t know the way, and don&#8217;t care
to trust to the men here now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if it is your own country, why don&#8217;t you
know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not my own country.&#8221; This surprised her,
and again she was silent for a time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; was the next question. &#8220;And
where do you belong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the name of the brigand.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<span class="imageright"><a href="#Page_136"><i>Page 136</i></a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>&#8220;I know that; but I am not a brigand. And now
I think you had better try and rest. If we are to
reach the railway to-morrow, it will be a long day&#8217;s
ride, and you must get some sleep. You can sleep
in perfect safety, the dog will stay with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a strange man, Burgwan. What are
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it matter so long as I can bring you out of
this plight? Do what I ask, please. Rest and get
sleep and strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you presume to give me your orders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, when they are for your good. Have you
eaten anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for me to give orders, not to obey them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you eaten what I brought you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So far well, then. Good-night;&#8221; and I moved
a pace or two away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be out here all night within call. And you
have Chris.&#8221; She looked at me in the moonlight and
our eyes met.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do I trust you, Burgwan?&#8221; I started with
pleasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter so long as you do. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a shame for you to have to stay there all
night; but I shall feel safe if you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right.&#8221; I was smitten suddenly with
nervousness and answered brusquely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall sleep, Burgwan. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her tone had a touch of gentle confidence, and I
thought she smiled. But I did not look straight at
her and made no reply.</p>

<p>In one way she was a witch, truly enough; she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
cast over me a spell which made me feel to her as I
had never felt toward any other woman; and I leaned
back against the wall with my arms folded thinking,
thinking, aye, and dreaming, for all that I was full
awake and my every sense alert and vigilant on my
watch.</p>

<p>Presently, how soon or how long afterwards I
know not, I heard the casement opened softly and
she peeped out and round at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are still there, Burgwan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said I would be, and I generally keep my word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not going to stand all night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; there&#8217;s a stone here that will serve for a seat
if I tire.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew in her head for a moment, and I heard
her move something in the cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a chair here and a rug. Take them;&#8221;
and she put them out through the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are kindly thoughtful,&#8221; I said. But here
again I seemed to cross the curious dividing line in
her thoughts, for she drew her head up, and looked
at me half indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night.&#8221; She spoke very stiffly, and closed
the casement with sharp abruptness.</p>

<p>But I forgave the action for the kindness of the
thought, and resumed my watch and my dreaming.</p>

<small>MORE WITCHCRAFT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The night hours sped away with only one incident
to disturb us. I heard a strange noise which I could
not locate nor understand, and as I stood listening
intently Chris, within the hut, barked loudly.</p>

<p>I heard the girl speak to him, and was half minded
to ask her to let him out that he might help my
watch; but I heard nothing more, and so let the thing
pass.</p>

<p>Day had broken before Karasch returned. He
was alone, and had only failure and mishap to report.
Trouble had dogged him from the start. He had
not seen a trace of the man he had gone out to find.
His companion&#8217;s horse had put his foot in a hole and
broken his leg, and nearly killed Andreas, who was
lying some fifteen miles away in the hills; while Karasch
himself had twice been thrown, the second time
with disastrous results to his broken arm.</p>

<p>He left no doubt as to where he laid the blame.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are bewitched, Burgwan,&#8221; he said, his brow
frowning and his glance threatening. &#8220;In five years
I have never once been thrown; and now twice
within as many hours. The spell was upon us, and
we were not meant to find the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does anyone cast spells for their own hurt, Karasch?
It was necessary for her safety that the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
should be caught and prevented from bringing his
comrades here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not of this country, or you would know
better. These devils work their own ends in their
own ways. I lifted my hand against you because of
her, and have brought the spell upon me. God defend
us;&#8221; and he crossed himself earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why should she help to bring her pursuers
here?&#8221; I repeated; and might as well have reasoned
with the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not know. He will never reach his
friends; or, if he does, the way hither will be hidden
from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a blind fool, Karasch,&#8221; I exclaimed,
losing my temper.</p>

<p>He looked at me and shook his head slowly with a
suggestion of commiseration.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not I who am the fool or blind, Burgwan,&#8221;
he answered, almost sadly. &#8220;Listen. The first time I
was thrown, I saw before me a stretch of beautiful
turf and pricked my horse to a gallop across it when
he plunged right into a pit; and I wonder I was not
killed. The next time, just before dawn, I was feeling
my way carefully when she herself appeared suddenly
in front of me, all white fire, and flashing a
gleaming sword before my eyes. I checked my
horse, in fear, and he reared and fell back almost on
top of me. Is not that enough to prove the spell?&#8221;</p>

<p>It proved to me that he had either been asleep on
his horse or was suffering from disordered nerves as
the result of fatigue and the pain from his arm; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
when I told him so, he grew more morose and pitying
in his manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know why you talk as you do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
have looked into her eyes. The spell is on you, too&mdash;on
all here; and we shall die&mdash;unless she does.&#8221;
The last three words were uttered after a long pause,
during which he had glanced ominously and fearsomely
toward the hut. Superstition held him in its
thrall.</p>

<p>I judged it best to check the thought under the
words at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who lays a finger on her to her hurt
will have to reckon with me, Karasch,&#8221; I said,
sternly, and turned away.</p>

<p>He made no reply, but rode on to the shed some
distance to the rear of the tent, where we stalled the
horses.</p>

<p>I began to scent a fresh danger for the &#8220;witch,&#8221;
and was fast growing as anxious as she herself could
be to get away. If Karasch believed that he would
be saving me from the spell by killing her, I knew he
was quite capable of doing it in the face of any commands
I might lay upon him and the others.</p>

<p>It was easy to guess at his crude reasoning. I had
looked into her eyes, and was thus under her spell
while she lived. My orders for her safety would
thus be regarded as the result of the accursed enchantment;
and they would only have to kill her to
free me from the spell and make me to see that they
had done the right thing. They would feel that I
should then be as eager to reward them for her murder
as I was now to forbid them touching her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Added to this was the actual and pressing danger
arising from the fact that the man who had pursued
her had escaped to carry the tidings of her whereabouts
to his companions and bring them down upon
us, perhaps in force.</p>

<p>The situation was growing tighter with every fresh
turn, and I made up my mind to rush matters and
get away at once. I would not wait for the return
of my guide, but take the risk of finding my way
alone.</p>

<p>I had just made this decision when Gartski came
running round the tent with a white, scared face. He
stopped some yards short of the hut, as if loath to
come too near the abode of the accursed one, and
crossed himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The horses have been killed, Burgwan. Will
you come to the shed to Karasch?&#8221;</p>

<p>The news, if true, was ill enough to make me
change colour, and I went back with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are all under a curse. It is witch&#8217;s work,&#8221;
he said in a curiously awed tone; and he wrung his
hands and crossed himself again. I was beginning
to regard that gesture of devotion with a pretty considerable
dislike by that time.</p>

<p>The news was true enough. The three horses lay
dead on the shed floor, each in a pool of blood; and
on the quarter of each of them a small ring of blood
was to be seen some two inches across. Peering
into the shed stood the horse from which Karasch
had just dismounted, his neck outstretched and his
ears cocked in fear.</p>

<p>Karasch and Petrov were inside, preternaturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
grave and awe-struck. Both looked as frightened as
Gartski when he had come running with the news to
me; and Karasch pointed ominously in turn at the
marks on each of the dead animals.</p>

<p>&#8220;The witch&#8217;s mark. It&#8217;s always there,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>It was unquestionably very strange, and I looked
solemn enough no doubt to lead them to believe I
was beginning to share their own superstitious fears.
It was about the worst thing that could have occurred
at such a juncture; and for the moment I could think
of nothing but the possible consequences of so disastrous
an occurrence.</p>

<p>With an effort I roused myself and examined the
&#8220;witch&#8217;s&#8221; mark on each of the beasts. A circle had
been cut with the point of a sharp knife, the mark
being just skin deep.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did they die, do you think, Karasch?&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed again to the marks and smiled grimly,
as though the cause were too plain to need words.</p>

<p>&#8220;And all this blood?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>He shrugged his great shoulders.</p>

<p>I looked at Gartski and the third man closely, for
any sign that they had had a hand in it; but their
superstitious fear was too genuine to be doubted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn the horses over,&#8221; I ordered; but they
shrank away and obstinately refused to put a finger
near them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is smeared with the blood of a witch-killed
beast dies before the moon is old,&#8221; said Karasch.
&#8220;They must burn where they lie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a set of fools,&#8221; I cried angrily. But
neither anger nor request was heeded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>I took the iron bar from the door, and levering it
under the smallest of the horses turned the carcase
over sufficiently to find what I sought&mdash;the cause of
death. There was a wound just under the heart.
The horse had been stabbed with a sword or long
knife. Whoever had done the work knew where and
how to strike so as to kill instantly.</p>

<p>I went outside then and searched the ground all
round the door carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back to the tent all of you,&#8221; I said. I led
the way, scrutinising every inch of the ground and
following a somewhat unaccountable trail I had discovered.
It led direct to the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see to your arm, Karasch,&#8221; I said first,
intending to let them have some minutes to recover
from the first effects of their stupefaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Burgwan. You have cursed blood on you.
You cannot touch me. I should die, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then, we&#8217;ll settle this thing first. You
saddled Karasch&#8217;s horse last night, Gartski. Did
you fasten the shed afterwards?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; we never fasten it. Bars won&#8217;t keep out
devils.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the work of no devil. Those horses have
been killed by someone who plunged a knife into
their hearts and then cut that ring on the haunch.
I saw the wound myself on the beast I examined.
They were all right when you left them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, quite right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did either of you go near the shed again until
Karasch returned, or did you sleep?&#8221; I asked next,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
remembering the strange noise I had heard in the
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had had a long day, and both slept soundly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting very close to it now,&#8221; I answered.
I turned to our prisoner with the broken leg. &#8220;How
is your leg this morning, my man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very painful, but better,&#8221; he replied after a
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you sleep, or did you hear anything in the
night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I slept all through the night. I was asleep when
you came in just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it ought not to be so painful. I&#8217;ll have a
look at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he cried, putting up his hands to ward
me off. &#8220;Don&#8217;t touch me. You have touched the
accursed blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe in it, too?&#8221; and I looked keenly
at him.</p>

<p>He crossed himself earnestly and spat on the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay, stay. You&#8217;re a Turk! why do you cross
yourself with the cross of the Christians? I won&#8217;t
touch you against your will, but I must see how your
leg is doing. Lift him up, Gartski,&#8221; and I pointed to
a bench. They hesitated. &#8220;Do as I say; and
smartly, too. You know me,&#8221; I cried sternly.</p>

<p>The man objected and protested with many oaths,
and cursed me volubly. But I insisted; and the
others did not dare to disobey me. Karasch himself
plucked the man&#8217;s rug off, and the other two lifted
him.</p>

<p>The mystery was instantly plain to me. The man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
was smeared from head to foot with mud and blood,
the traces of which he had tried to remove; and lying
where his body had covered them were a knife and a
small lantern; while a glance at his injured leg
showed me that the splints had been all but torn off
in the exertions of his night&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>He was a faithful servant to his masters, whoever
they might be; and he had conceived the design of
killing the only horses we had, in order to prevent
the escape of the girl before his comrades could return
to recapture her.</p>

<p>Waiting until the two men in the tent were fast
asleep he had dragged himself, painfully and laboriously,
through the mud to the shed, had shut himself
in, and, by the light of the lantern he carried, had
deliberately stabbed one horse after the other, putting
on each the witch&#8217;s mark. He knew the superstition
about it, of course, and trusted to that to save
him from the risk of discovery. I had seen the slimy
trail he had left in the mud, however, and had thus
detected him.</p>

<p>With what dogged effort he had acted and the
stoical endurance he had shown were evidenced by
the condition of his wounded leg. The splints had
been torn off, and he must have suffered excruciating
agony in the grating of the fractured bones.</p>

<p>I taxed him with the deed, but he denied it, of
course, and swore by every oath he could think of,
Christian and Mahomedan alike, that he was innocent
and had slept soundly the whole night through.</p>

<p>I drew Karasch aside. &#8220;You can see for yourself
what happened,&#8221; I said, significantly and triumphantly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
But his superstition was proof even against
such evidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not understand, Burgwan; I do,&#8221; he replied,
in the same dismal fanatical tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing can be seen as plainly as a mountain in
the moonlight,&#8221; I exclaimed, impatiently. &#8220;He
wants to prevent our getting away until his companions
get here.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Karasch only shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see that he did it, can&#8217;t you, man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see she used his body to do it. They often
do that. He did it in a dream. His hand; her mind.
I&#8217;ll question him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And put a ready-made lie into his thoughts,&#8221; I
exclaimed, angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is witch&#8217;s work, more than his,&#8221; he repeated,
stubbornly and doggedly. I felt I should lose my
temper if I stayed longer, and tossing up my hands
in despair at his folly, I gave up talking sense to him.</p>

<p>I washed off the traces of the blood from my hands,
and having got materials for a breakfast, went away
to the hut to try and think what next to do in view
of this fresh disaster.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I had ever been more completely
cornered than I was by the position which faced me
then. I was thirty miles or so from anywhere; I
did not know the road for even a league from the
camp; and I hadn&#8217;t an animal left worth calling a
horse. If I attempted to leave with the girl, we should
probably be lost, or break down by the way. Yet
if I stayed where I was, we should have her pursuers
back to fetch her; while, even if they did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
not come, there was an almost hourly risk that my
own men would break out against her in order to
deliver me from her enchantment.</p>

<p>Whichever way I turned I could see nothing but
imminent peril for her&mdash;peril of death indeed; and
cudgel my wits as I would, I could see no turning in
the long, straight lane of danger.</p>

<p>I remember stopping midway between the tent
and the hut, and setting down the things I carried,
and glancing round at the circle of frowning hills
with a confused and dismaying sense of feebleness.
The breeze of the morning, fresh and invigorating
as it was, seemed to grow hot, stifling, oppressive,
until it was positively difficult to breathe freely. The
hills had become suddenly as the walls of a prison,
shutting me in, a helpless, crippled prisoner. Light,
freedom, hope, life were all on the other side of
them, but the path was barred and the way of escape
blocked. My nerves were shaken and the mental
perspective warped, for the moment, in the exaggeration
of sudden alarm for the girl.</p>

<p>The sight of her brought me to my senses again.
She appeared at the door of the hut and looking
about her saw me and smiled. I must keep the
knowledge of danger from her, of course, so I went
down and pretended to busy myself with my packages
while I pulled myself together.</p>

<p>I picked them up and went on to the hut whistling
a strain of the &#8220;Star Spangled Banner,&#8221; and trying
to appear as if I hadn&#8217;t a thought in the world above
breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Burgwan,&#8221; she said, with a sort
of chary patronage and encouragement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>&#8220;Good-morning. I have brought your breakfast.
Very homely diet, but the best we can offer you
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind. What time do we start?&#8221; She
had a rare knack of finding awkward questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;The guide is not come yet,&#8221; I answered, conscious
that my pause would rouse her suspicions.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I cannot wait long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough.&#8221; I spoke the thought aloud,
unwittingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221; Very sharply asked,
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t answer any questions yet. I have to
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>The reply appeared to offend her, and her eyes
flashed as she drew herself up with a gesture of
authority and constraint. She was turning back into
the hut when she caught sight of some stains on my
clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is&mdash;blood?&#8221; She paused before the word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s blood. I didn&#8217;t know it was there.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrank from me for a space against the lintel.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s horse&#8217;s blood. We&#8217;ve had some trouble in
the stables, and I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t cut a very pretty
figure just now.&#8221; I tried to make light of it in this
way; but it was a feeble effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me&mdash;at once. The truth, please.&#8221; There
was eagerness now in her tone, as well as the usual
imperative note.</p>

<p>I hesitated. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;d better know it,&#8221;
I said then. &#8220;There has been foul play in the night,
and our horses have been killed. I got this on me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
when I was tracing the thing to its source. That&#8217;s
all&mdash;but it&#8217;s bad enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All but one&mdash;and he&#8217;s dead lame, I&#8217;m afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this true? or is it an excuse to keep me here?&#8221;</p>

<p>I winced. The injustice bit deep. I looked at her
with a protest in my eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll put that question plainly, perhaps you&#8217;ll
see it in its proper light, and understand how it may
sound to me. No, I don&#8217;t mean that. It doesn&#8217;t
matter. I have told you the truth; that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it does mean delay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry; but thirty or forty miles make a
long march for a lame horse. I could manage on
foot, of course, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; I left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>She started, and bit her lip as she realised my
meaning. To avoid seeing her distress, and to fill
the pause, I dropped one of the tins I was carrying
and stooped to pick it up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have to beg your pardon, Burgwan, for doubting
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no account, I assure you. I couldn&#8217;t have
helped it myself if the position had been reversed.
The truth does sometimes look strangely like falsehood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t seem to understand that I must
get away. I must.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do realise it,&#8221; I answered, very earnestly, &#8220;and
mean to find a way, somehow. I&#8217;m not easy to beat,
most times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When can we start, then?&#8221; I noticed the &#8220;we,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
and I think it had something to do with putting me
off my guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall have to think a bit,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be soon, Burgwan. What time is it
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Without thinking, I pulled out my watch from an
inner pocket&mdash;a big gold chronometer on a gold
chain&mdash;and the moment I caught her quick eyes on
it I saw the mistake, and regretted it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just six o&#8217;clock,&#8221; I answered, as indifferently as
I could.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a very valuable watch you carry in these
lonely hills;&#8221; and her look spoke her thought much
more eloquently than her words.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very good timekeeper,&#8221; I answered at
random.</p>

<p>Her intent gaze held me all the while, and I saw
gathering in her eyes something of the suspicion with
which she had first heard my name the previous
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you not over quick with your suspicions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I to fear you&mdash;or trust you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you trust me it will have to be without asking
any questions&mdash;at present. You have no reason to
fear me; and never will have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must tell me where you got so valuable a
thing&mdash;you, a peasant of the hills?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not a peasant of the hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I told you, you would scarcely believe me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; she insisted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>&#8220;I bought it; that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath and bit her lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have thought of you as a brave man capable of
real nobleness. I have believed you to be true and
honest. If you fail me I have no hope. And if you
mean me harm, for the sake of the living God tell me
so.&#8221; She spoke with intense but carefully restrained
passion until the last few words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take it like that,&#8221; I replied, firmly and
calmly, although moved to the core by her appeal.
&#8220;I will tell you something. I am not what I may
have seemed to you. I am no peasant and no
brigand, as you seem to fear. Who and what I am,
and why here, I cannot tell you yet; but, believe this,
I will serve you and save you from this trouble. If
you wish it, I will take any oath you like on that.
But my word is my word, and you may trust it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She listened intently, marking every word, and
when I finished she bent forward and gazed searchingly
right into my eyes. Then she drew a deep,
long breath, as of relief, and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, I feel I can trust you. I will not
question you again, Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the best thing you can do is to show it by
getting some breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>The change to the commonplace and practical
from that moment of feverish passion was a welcome
relief to us both.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; you are right. I will,&#8221; she answered, forcing
a smile; and picking up the things I had laid on
the chair, she carried them into the hut.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />


<small>A CONTEST IN WILL POWER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>After that incident there was something of a
change in the curious relations between us. She was
just as imperious at times; but less patronising. She
seemed to expect my services less as a return for payment
to be made, or by right of caste and station,
than in virtue of her womanhood and helplessness.
Either she now believed entirely in my good faith,
or she was anxious to make me think she did.</p>

<p>I explained to her how I generally contrived to
prepare my food, showed her how to manage the
spirit stove, pointed out where the few things needful
were kept, and offered to make the meal ready
for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not helpless, and can do it myself, thank
you,&#8221; she said, half resentfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; I answered, and soon after left
her to it. I went back to the tent to wash my face
and hands and endeavour to get the blood stains from
my clothes. I began to be disquietingly conscious
of my exceedingly ungroomed condition.</p>

<p>The men were eating their breakfasts and talking
together with lowered brow and gloomy faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we to do, Burgwan?&#8221; asked Karasch,
coming over to me presently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;There will be no work to-day. I shall remain in
camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is to fetch Andreas?&#8221; This was the man
who had ridden with him on the previous night and
lay out on the hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t spare the horse, now we have only one.
One of you must take food to him on foot, and try
to hire or buy some horses in place of the dead ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not do,&#8221; he said, lowering his voice. &#8220;I
cannot walk so far; and you can&#8217;t trust the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can trust Gartski.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not after this morning&#8217;s business with the witch-killed
beasts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk such nonsense, Karasch. I proved to
you that that treacherous devil over there stabbed
them to prevent us getting away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has explained that. He had a vision and
remembers it now. She stood over him with a flaming
sword, just as she appeared to me, and compelled
him to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How a man of your shrewdness can believe such
rot passes my understanding, Karasch. You might
be a great baby if I didn&#8217;t know you were a brave and
clever man.&#8221; But flattery was of no more use than
reproaches.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand these things, Burgwan.
We do. You see with her eyes; we use our own.&#8221;
The dogged manner and tone alike showed that he
spoke with dead conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the best thing will be for the lot of you to
clear out,&#8221; I exclaimed testily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t be left alone in her power. I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
stay with you to the end. You gave me my life when
I had lost it fairly, and I&#8217;ll save yours in return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; I asked sharply, as a glint
of his intention shot into my thoughts. Instead of
meeting my eyes as usual, he looked down and
shuffled uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;The spell must be broken and then you&#8217;ll see the
truth and&mdash;and no harm may come to you after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Speak out, Karasch, and
meet my eyes openly like a man, as you usually do.&#8221;</p>

<p>But this he would not or could not do.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one way,&#8221; he said doggedly. &#8220;And
it must come to that in the end. We have talked it
over. Your life must be saved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have thought you all knew by this time
that I can take pretty good care of that for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one way,&#8221; he repeated in the same
dogged tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is that way? Out with it, man, in
plain terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She must die, Burgwan, or you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought a moment, and then saw a different line
and promptly adopted it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too late, Karasch,&#8221; I said, as gravely
and solemnly as I could speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, there is always time within the same moon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; she has rendered me proof against any knife
or bullet for three days on condition that I defend
her. And I&#8217;ve sworn that I will die before anyone
shall harm her.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a beautiful bluff. He started back and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
looked at me in manifest horror and crossed himself
as he muttered a prayer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that, you hurt me, Karasch,&#8221; I said,
pretending to shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great God of all. And you a Christian, Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>His agitation was almost piteous. He turned
deathly pale and beads of perspiration stood on his
forehead, as he stared at me horror-struck. &#8220;And
I have sworn to save you.&#8221; It was just a whisper of
dismay and helplessness, and it showed the struggle
which was raging between his superstition and his
fealty to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll release you from your oath to me, if you
wish; and you and the rest can leave as soon as you
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, by God, no; not if I&#8217;m damned forever,&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stand by you, Burgwan, mad blind fool
though you&#8217;ve been. Curse the witch and all her
infernal arts;&#8221; and he was at it again with his vehement
crossing and spitting and prayers.</p>

<p>His devotion moved me deeply. I knew how much
the effort must cost him. He believed that he was
jeopardising not his life only, that he was always
ready to risk, but his very soul as well. Rough,
coarse, crude, ignorant, half civilised boor that he
was, he had shown a fidelity to me such as I had
never witnessed before. He should have a reward;
and it should be rich enough to surprise him if ever
we got out of this mess; but I could say nothing of
it to him then. He would have laughed to scorn the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
promise of money in such a case. I accepted his
sacrifice therefore without another word.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do about Andreas?&#8221; I asked.
&#8220;Gartski and Petrov had better go out to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. If they go, it will be only to find help and
bring others back here to do what you say must not
be done. Andreas must take his chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must go somewhere then, and find us
horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I take my eyes off those two they&#8217;ll run away.
I must stay to watch them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we must have horses and at once,&#8221; I urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell her to send some here. She can if she
chooses.&#8221; His belief in her supernatural powers was
complete; but that time it served to turn the tables
with a vengeance. I had no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be as you say. I&#8217;ll ask her;&#8221; and with
that I left the tent, wishing that the miraculous
supply of horses were as easy of accomplishment as
Karasch believed.</p>

<p>There was one that I could have, however, and I
deemed it best to make sure that neither Gartski nor
Petrov should have the chance of stealing it. So I
led it over to the cottage to tether it close at hand,
carrying the saddle with me.</p>

<p>Hearing me, the girl came out.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have horses, then?&#8221; she asked, in a tone of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have this one, that&#8217;s all;&#8221; and I fastened it up
to a tree close by the hut.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are looking very serious, Burgwan. Has
anything more happened?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>&#8220;A little misunderstanding with the men. Nothing
more serious than I&#8217;ve had before. Have you
breakfasted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I have yours here;&#8221; and she brought out
to me coffee and a steaming dish of food which she
had prepared for me with her own dainty hands. She
might have been a witch, indeed, for the cleverness
with which she had concocted a savoury meal from
the rough fare at her disposal.</p>

<p>I was very hungry, and while I ate it with thankfulness
and relish she fed Chris.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dog takes to you, readily,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Good Chris,&#8221; and he wagged his tail and
looked up at her. &#8220;He is another mystery, Burgwan&mdash;like
that watch;&#8221; and she smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and in his way quite as reliable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not a breed often found&mdash;in the hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was fishing, but I would not see the bait, and
answered with a monosyllable.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very fond of you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows me and trusts me, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a reproach?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not for me to reproach you. You don&#8217;t
know me yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are many things I don&#8217;t know yet. For
one, how I got here to this hut?&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled. &#8220;I carried you,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You dared?&#8221; A quick impulsive rebuke in the
question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t dare to leave you lying out there in the
road when that storm was coming up.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>&#8220;You had no right,&#8221; she cried, and went back into
the hut.</p>

<p>Chris looked up as she went and ran to the door
after her; but returned and finished his breakfast, and
then went in to her.</p>

<p>I had finished mine then, and sat thinking over the
position of things when she came out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wrong to be angry, Burgwan. Of course,
there was nothing else for you to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t think of anything, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought not to have been so childish as to faint,&#8221;
she said, with a smile and a shrug. Then she picked
my cup and platter. &#8220;Where can I get water to
wash these?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t bother about that. It&#8217;s not fit work
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I wish to,&#8221; she cried, with a little stamp of
the foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a spring close here, then,&#8221; I replied; and
taking a pannikin I fetched the water and sat down
again and went on with my thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we start now, Burgwan?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I
wish to reach the railway that will carry me to Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That means thirty miles through a country
where I don&#8217;t know a yard of the road;&#8221; and I
shook my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You always raise difficulties.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t raise them, I see them. That&#8217;s all.
I wish I didn&#8217;t. It may come to it at the last&mdash;but
we had better wait for the guide. He ought to be
here soon now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t the men know the road?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had better wait for the guide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are not you the leader here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a way, yes; but not in such a matter. I am
thinking all I know to find the best thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But suppose the others should come first before
this guide, what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What others?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The rest of the men who were taking me to
Maglai.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you were going to Maglai. How many
were there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Six. Four beside the two you captured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far from here were you when you escaped?&#8221;
I noticed that she no longer resented my questions as
on the previous night.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It was about noon, and they
called a halt; and having fed and drunk they lay down
and slept, leaving one to watch. But he fell asleep,
too, with the heat, and I stole off. I rode fast for
some hours, and then was going slowly, thinking I
was safe from pursuit, when suddenly the two appeared
in the distance and chased me. I let my
horse go where it would, and it carried me here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had been riding about seven hours or so,
then. That means fourteen at least, without the
delay of the storm; and then he&#8217;d have to chance finding
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whom do you mean by &#8216;he&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had been calculating roughly how long it would
take the man Karasch had set free to reach his friends
and return with them, and unwittingly had spoken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the thought aloud. I pretended not to hear her
question.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know whether all the men rode after
you on the same road, or spread out in different
directions?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>She made no reply, and when I glanced up I met
her eyes bent earnestly upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are concealing something from me. You
heard my question, I know, for I saw you start.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the curious feeling that I was at a disadvantage
sitting down below her, I stood up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better leave the run of this thing to me.
I won&#8217;t ask any more questions than I am compelled;
and if they bother you, you can turn a deaf ear to
them, as I do when I don&#8217;t want to hear yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Signs of rebellion flashed from her eyes, and she
made ready to give battle. She held her head high
and squared her shapely shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be dictated to like that, and I won&#8217;t
remain here on any such terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not dictating; I&#8217;m talking common sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t submit to it; I will not.&#8221; And she
stamped her foot. &#8220;I will have an answer to my
question. I won&#8217;t have things hidden from me.
Why won&#8217;t you answer it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you I had my deaf ear to it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you try to pass it off with a flippant
jest like that? Who are you to presume to insult
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think I wish to insult you?&#8221; I
asked, very quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you wish to do I neither know nor care.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
But it is an insult, as even the commonest instinct of
courtesy would tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We rough men of the hills haven&#8217;t much to do
with courtesy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not of the hills, you know that. You
told me you were no peasant. Do you suppose I
can&#8217;t see that for myself?&#8221; I made no reply, and
after a pause she added, &#8220;I know why it is you will
not answer me. You think I must be a coward because
I am a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that another of the commonest instincts of
courtesy&mdash;the average man&#8217;s courtesy, I mean?&#8221; I
said this with the deliberate intention of irritating
her to keep her away from the matter. But she saw
my purpose instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you answer that question of mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me finish first with mine, and then you ask
what you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused to think, and then nodded as if in
answer to her thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not a coward to be frightened by bad news,
and I have already guessed the answer to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there can be no need for me to tell it you,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>She waited again, and then looking at me fixedly
said, with an air of deliberate decision: &#8220;If you do
not tell me, I will not remain here another minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a challenge to a trial of wills; and I took
it up at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not a prisoner,&#8221; I said, and stepped aside
ostentatiously as if to leave the way free for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I have that horse there?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll saddle him for you. I can lead him down to
the ravine to where your horse lies, and get your side-saddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which road do I take to get to the railway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I can give you a map and a
compass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get them, please.&#8221; She had plenty of will, that
was certain; but I couldn&#8217;t afford to let her bluff me.
I went into the cottage and rummaged about till I
found the compass and the map, and then added a
touch of realism. I took a spare revolver and loaded
it, and held it out to her with some extra ammunition.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better take these as well.&#8221; She took
them and then drove in the spur in her turn, by saying
in her haughtiest manner:</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall be paid for them, Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can give the value of them to a charity in
Belgrade,&#8221; I answered. We were both angry now.
&#8220;Are you ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was pinning her hat, and when I saw that her
fingers trembled, I had hard work to persist. But I
held on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, after a moment.</p>

<p>We went out and I untethered the horse, and with
Chris in close attendance, we walked without speaking
to the mouth of the ravine, close to where her
horse still lay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you hold him, while I get the side-saddle?&#8221;
Our eyes met for a moment, and I saw that at last
she was convinced I was in earnest.</p>

<p>I turned away, feeling bad, and unbuckled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
girths from the dead animal, and then saddled the
one she was to ride. I took plenty of time over the
work, too, hoping she would see the madness of what
she proposed to do and give in. But she shewed no
sign of doing anything of the sort; and at last the
work was done.</p>

<p>&#8220;All is ready,&#8221; I said, giving a last look at the
bridle. &#8220;Can you mount by yourself, or shall I help
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no answer, but stood with her head half
averted, looking away down the steep mountain road.
She was biting her lips strenuously, and the fingers
which held up her skirt were tightly, almost fiercely,
clenched. Eloquent little proofs of the struggle that
was raging between pride and prudence. But I held
my tongue and just waited.</p>

<p>Then she turned to me. She was very pale, but
her eyes were flashing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were a man,&#8221; she cried, between
her set lips. I met her look steadily without a word.
And we stood so for the space of some seconds;
her face the embodiment of hot passionate contemptuousness;
mine as impassive as a stone. &#8220;And
what a coward you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>I stood as though my ears were indeed deaf.</p>

<p>She still hesitated; and the woman who hesitates
can be saved as well as lost.</p>

<p>Then came the last effort of her pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lead the horse to that stone. I will not soil
myself by letting you help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I led him where she pointed; and she mounted with
the ease of a practised horsewoman. She even gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
up the reins and settled herself in the saddle;
and then waited to look almost yearningly for some
sign from me. I gave none, but held the bridle as if
I had been her groom.</p>

<p>Chris stood looking from one to the other of us
as if in deep perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you take the dog?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>Then came the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean me to go?&#8221; It was all I had been
waiting for.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not now,&#8221; I answered at once; &#8220;since you
see the folly of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you? I <span class="allsmcap">WILL</span> go now;&#8221; and she
gripped the reins tightly and touched the horse with
her heel. But he hadn&#8217;t much fire in him, and
obeyed my hand on the bridle instead of her heel.
I held him with my left hand and stretched out the
other toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come; you had better dismount. This folly has
gone far enough;&#8221; and I put as much command and
authority as possible into my tone.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the look she gave me, nor my
surprise when a second later she put her hand into
mine and slipped off the saddle. The rush of relief
was too great for her to simulate further anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;How hard you can be. I though you meant it,&#8221;
she murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t try us both in this way,&#8221; I said.
&#8220;I had to show you that my will is stronger than
yours; and you made the lesson hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have let me go?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, certainly not.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;Oh, I wish I had held out,&#8221; she exclaimed, vehemently.</p>

<p>I smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;We call it bluff in the States; and I am an older
hand at it than you. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The States?&#8221; she asked quickly. &#8220;What
States?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;United States. I am an American, you see, naturalised,
that is; I&#8217;m English by birth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;American? English? But I thought....&#8221;</p>

<p>Face, eyes, everything eloquent of questioning surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. You thought all sorts of things
except the right one. But anyway, I&#8217;m not quite
the coward you thought just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t again. Come, let us get back to the
cottage. We haven&#8217;t lost after all by this&mdash;we have
the side-saddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to think or say,&#8221; she cried, in
dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand your purpose. But let us get
back, please;&#8221; and with that we went, I leading the
horse as before and she walking by my side, Chris
keeping close to her as though in some way he understood
everything.</p>

<p>Again it was a silent walk at first; but this time
the motives for silence were very different.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_066.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<small>UNWELCOME VISITORS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>That contest of wills, followed by my avowal that
I was an American, marked another very distinct advance
toward a better understanding between us.
My companion&#8217;s interest was stimulated and her
curiosity piqued; and our relationship was at once
placed upon a footing of personal equality. She
made that plain&mdash;intentionally, I think&mdash;her momentary
chagrin at defeat in the trial of strength between
us overshadowed completely by her sense of
relief and reassurance.</p>

<p>Chris was a great help to us just then. He seemed
to have settled it in his thoughts there had been
trouble which was now put right, and he stalked
along by her side, thrusting his great nose into her
hand, nestling his head against her, and giving many
signs of his satisfaction. She caressed him gently,
and presently, with a half glance at me, she said, as
if to him:</p>

<p>&#8220;And are you American, too, Chris? And is your
name really Chris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s American born, not like his master, and his
name is really Chris,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;And have you a strong temper, too, Chris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like master like dog. He can show his teeth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
at need,&#8221; I said with a smile. &#8220;But he can be a
staunch friend&mdash;to those who trust him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he show them to women?&#8221; she asked, turning
to flash her eyes upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that quite fair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can show yours,&#8221; she said, shrugging her
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen him hold a man up with a growl when
I knew he didn&#8217;t mean to bite. Just as a lesson, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would trust my hand between <span class="allsmcap">HIS</span> teeth,&#8221; she
answered, as she thrust her fingers into his great
mouth. The rascal mouthed them, and fawned upon
her and looked up in her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, he&#8217;s kissing it&mdash;to congratulate you on having
made peace,&#8221; I said drily; and she drew her hand
away so heartily that for a moment I feared I had
offended her. But I had not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does <span class="allsmcap">HE</span> understand what you call &#8216;bluff&#8217;?&#8221; was
her next question, after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very much like me in many ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can believe that. He is so silent about himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like us both in that, perhaps, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a reproach or a question?&#8221; she retorted,
and added, seriously, &#8220;I cannot tell you about myself;
but you shall know some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not asking. We&#8217;ll leave it unsaid on both
sides, shall we&mdash;at any rate for the present&mdash;and
just take each other on trust?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As you will. I have learnt my lesson and shall
not question you.&#8221; The reply was given with a mixture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
of irony, rebellion, and assumed submissiveness
in manner and tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to find you so ready a pupil. Chris
there could tell you that where there&#8217;s a toughish job
to handle he finds it best to let me go my own way.&#8221;
We had reached the cottage, and she was entering
the door as I said this. She turned quickly, and
threw up her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You expect a dog&#8217;s obedience, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From Chris, yes,&#8221; and I smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;From me, I mean. You know I mean that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From you I ask nothing except to do what your
judgment prompts, tempered perhaps by your trust
in&mdash;in Chris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Chris&#8217;s master, you mean. Why don&#8217;t you
say it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Chris would do nothing I didn&#8217;t approve; so
it&#8217;s about the same thing,&#8221; I answered, and led the
horse away, tethered him, and having loosened the
girths gave him a feed, and fetched him some water
from the spring. When I returned with it she was
standing by the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I help you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in this, thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what, then? I have nothing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t find you anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you do any work in the camp, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-day. You see it&#8217;s a kind of holiday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The work here is finished. I&#8217;m getting ready to
leave. As soon as Georgev&mdash;that&#8217;s the guide, you
know&mdash;gets back, I shall be off.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>&#8220;I suppose I am not to ask what the work was?&#8221;
She asked this with a smile and a shrug, contriving
to convey the impression that while she was impatiently
curious the question had behind it no vestige
of distrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not intend to tell you, but if you wish it I
will. This is a prospecting expedition. I&#8217;ve been
looking to see if any mines could be opened here.
Of course, it&#8217;s a sort of secret, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re hoping to make money here?&#8221; and
the glance she gave at my clothes told me her
thought. &#8220;You are an engineer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am a prospector. I have done it before in
the States.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will be successful. But I am sure
you will. You are the kind of man that does succeed;
so masterful, I mean.&#8221; We both smiled at the
word. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she added, as if in answer to my
thought; &#8220;I am judging by what has just occurred,
for one thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I seem a bit of a brute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. I&mdash;I was very angry when I
said what I did. I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t mean it; and I&#8217;m&mdash;I&#8217;m
sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not. I know you don&#8217;t think it now; but
you meant it then; and it was just what anyone else
would have meant and said. It helped us to understand
things better. That&#8217;s all. I was very much
afraid you meant to ride off alone, and then ...
well, I don&#8217;t know about then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I had known your thoughts,&#8221; she said,
with a sort of half mischievous regret.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>&#8220;You mean you would have outplayed me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded and smiled, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, please don&#8217;t try it again. It might be very
dangerous play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t, I promise you,&#8221; she said readily, understanding
from my serious tone that I was very much
in earnest. &#8220;When you use that tone I have no
rebellion left in me. I am like Chris, I suppose, in
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chris himself interrupted us then by growling, and
looking round I saw Karasch coming from the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chris hates Karasch,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;The man
struck him once savagely, and I had all my work to
keep the dog from his throat. He never forgets.
You can see now that every hair on his neck is bristling
with anger; and Karasch won&#8217;t come near him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a fierce looking man,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he will serve me now, faithfully, and Chris
must make friends with him. Will you go into the
hut a moment? Come, Chris,&#8221; and as she went away
I led the dog to Karasch and made him understand
that he was to regard the man as a friend. It was
not easy, for Karasch himself was afraid; but I stood
by while he patted the dog&#8217;s head, and I made Chris
lick his hand. Then I sent him back to the hut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Karasch, what is it?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil is it, Burgwan. I slept and Petrov has
gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was ugly news, and made me grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you couldn&#8217;t even keep watch, for all your
big words,&#8221; I said angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has never chanced so before,&#8221; he replied sullenly;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and his glance across toward the cottage told
me the thought behind the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were to cut your finger I suppose you&#8217;d
set it down to the same cause just now. You have
served me an ill turn. You can send Gartski to find
him, the sooner the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are mad, Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mad to have trusted to your keeping awake, perhaps.
Not in this. If one has got away, where&#8217;s
the use of keeping the other? When we had both
safe, it was well; but two can do no more harm than
one away; and we needn&#8217;t be bothered by keeping
watch over a traitor. I&#8217;ll speak to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come here, Gartski.&#8221; He rose sheepishly and
crossed to me. &#8220;How long has Petrov been gone,
and where has he gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was asleep, and know nothing,&#8221; he lied glibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday, when the trouble was here, you took
my side; now you are against me, and want to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not against you,&#8221; he began, with much
gesticulation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lie. I have means of knowing everything
in your thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrank back a pace and trembled, and crossed
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what I mean, I see,&#8221; I said. It was
no good to have a reputation for witchcraft and not
make use of it. &#8220;If you lie to me now,&#8221; I went on,
looking into his eyes with as fierce an expression as
I could assume, &#8220;you will not outlive the present
moon. Tell the truth, and no harm will come to
you.&#8221; Glancing at my hand I saw I had broken the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
skin in tending the horse, and I smeared a little circle
of blood on the tent post close by. &#8220;If that dries before
you speak, it will be too late, Gartski,&#8221; I said,
solemnly.</p>

<p>It seemed to be a very reliable card to play, this
superstition of theirs. He looked at the little circle
in horror, his face went ashen white and he trembled
violently.</p>

<p>&#8220;We meant nothing against you, Burgwan; only
against the witch,&#8221; he mumbled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is drying fast, Gartski. Beware.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Petrov has gone to get help to deal with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To murder her, you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no murder. To kill her for your sake, I
swear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where has he gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the priest at Lalwor&mdash;the hill village.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is that, and in which direction?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Four leagues up the hills to the south.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long has he been gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Less than an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come;&#8221; and I put my hand on his shoulders, and
led him out of the tent. &#8220;I have no use for spies
and traitors here. You can go after him. Get away,
or I&#8217;ll set the dog on you;&#8221; and with that I shoved
him from me&mdash;with a parting kick to which the rage
I felt gave additional force. He limped a few paces
and then turned and looked back at me. &#8220;Go,&#8221; I
thundered, making a step toward him, and then he
ran in a limping fashion comical enough to have
drawn a smile had the position been less grave.</p>

<p>I had frightened enough of the truth out of him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
to show me that no ill results could follow for a few
hours. It would take Petrov some three hours to
reach the hill village; some time would be needed to
get together a posse, and I felt that I might safely
wait an hour or two longer in the hope that Georgev
would arrive.</p>

<p>But it was clear now that we might have to start
before he arrived, so I questioned Karasch as to his
knowledge of the country which we should have to
cross. Somewhat to my dismay he declared he knew
nothing of it.</p>

<p>I returned to the hut then and found the &#8220;witch&#8221;
studying the map.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to ask you for that,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can we start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet; I am still waiting for the guide and the
horses he may have with him; but I want to make
out our way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of giving it to me she clasped her hands
over it as it lay on her lap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to ask you a favour.&#8221; Things were
changing indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me what all this means? You
have had more words with your men. I know it is
about me. Won&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are a set of fools; and they are all gone
now, except the big fellow, Karasch, whose arm is
hurt&mdash;broken, in fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, it is on my account, and, of course,
also it means danger of some kind. I am not afraid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
to know it with&mdash;with Chris and&mdash;and you to protect
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have quarrelled with the men&mdash;have just kicked
one of them out of the camp, in fact. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed and lifted her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see that this uncertainty is worse to
bear than any knowledge could be, however bad?&#8221;
She was strangely gentle now.</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t exaggerate things because you
don&#8217;t know them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is the map. You try me very much. Tell
me, please,&#8221; she urged as I took the map. I fingered
it thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not frighten yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not frightened&mdash;except that I think there
must be some terrifying news you keep back, fearing
to frighten me. You put a great strain on my
nerves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not thought of that, and there is no need
for it. I will tell you enough to show you that. I
have had trouble with the men; and it is about you.
They are only under me because I hired them to do
certain work. Well, that prisoner whom I shot in
the leg yesterday got at them with a tale that you
were a prisoner of such importance that a considerable
sum of money was to be paid for your safe delivery
at Maglai; and they had a fancy to help in earning
it. We quarrelled about it, and they&#8217;ve left the
camp.”</p>

<p>&#8220;Who do they say I am?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They do not know, and could not tell me; of
course; and I myself do not even know how to address<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
you. You must have seen this&mdash;whether madame
or mademoiselle even?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You put your question adroitly, Burgwan. Are
you Burgwan, really? But you can&#8217;t be, of course.
You are American.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the name I have here; and I did not know
how pleasant a sound it had until I heard you speak
it. I would rather you called me by that name than
any other. And you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She had her hands in her lap and kept her eyes
bent down as she slowly clasped and unclasped her
white fingers. Then she lifted her face and looked
at me with a slow, hesitating smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might call me&mdash;Barinschja.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is Russian for an unmarried woman, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you think I was married?&#8221; The smile in her
grey eyes was unmistakably brighter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not think you were Russian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not. I am a Serb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what we have to do is to get you to Belgrade
as soon as possible, Barinschja,&#8221; and I turned
to the map.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I cannot be Barinschja to you. I will be
mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you.&#8221; I understand enough Russian to
appreciate the difference. Barinschja is from inferior
to superior; mademoiselle from equal to equal.
&#8220;Then it shall be mademoiselle. Now for the map.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not yet. You have forgotten something.
You have spoken of the man you wounded yesterday,
but not of the one you fought and bound. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
he who has gone free, isn&#8217;t it, to fetch his comrades?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I did not mean to tell you. How did
you guess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From what you said before you&mdash;before we
fetched that side-saddle.&#8221; She smiled as she changed
the phrase. &#8220;When you would not answer the question,
which I tried to force you to answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle is very quick-witted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Burgwan can be very obstinate,&#8221; she retorted;
and I smiled in my turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fellow was set free by my men, but I do not
think he can get back in time to do any harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why have your men deserted you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were not bound to remain with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the desertion had nothing to do with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I told you we quarrelled about you. But I
wish to see our course; will you let me study the
map?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you will assure me that their desertion
bodes no danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Burgwan or Mademoiselle in charge of things
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will Burgwan answer Mademoiselle&#8217;s question?
Why did those men say there was a price on my
head?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all nonsense, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I wish to know. I have a right to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They said you had done something or other, and
that they were to be paid handsomely for getting
you to Maglai.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know what they said?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;Yes&mdash;that you had committed some crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some crime!&#8221; she cried, in quite indignant
astonishment. Then she laughed scornfully. &#8220;Do
you believe it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. If I did, it would make no difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A criminal! With a price on my head! What
can it mean?&#8221; This was more to herself than to me,
so I plunged into a study of the map, and in a few
minutes had made out a part of the route we should
have to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no criminal, Burgwan,&#8221; she said, breaking
in suddenly on my study of the map.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t need to be told. This is the way we shall
have to go at first&#8221;; and I drew her attention to the
map.</p>

<p>While we were examining it, Chris grew restless,
and at length got up and stood sniffing the air and
the ground and listening.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Chris, old dog?&#8221;</p>

<p>He came and nosed my hand and then went a few
yards off and pointing towards the ravine, growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone is about,&#8221; I said, as I folded up the map
and put it in my pocket. &#8220;Will you go into the hut,
Mademoiselle? It may be the guide Georgev&mdash;or it
may not; and may mean trouble of some sort. Take
Chris with you and shut the door. He&#8217;ll answer for
anyone who tries to bother you. Chris, inside; on
guard, good dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>He understood and obeyed at once, although his
eyes said he would rather stay with me.</p>

<p>I strolled half way to the tent and called to Karasch,
who came out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>&#8220;I think someone is coming up the ravine, Karasch.
It may be Georgev, or some of the men in
search of Mademoiselle yonder. You mean to stand
by me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On my oath, yes. But if they are in search of
her, you&#8217;d better give her to them, Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that fool talk, and leave everything to me;
and do exactly as I tell you from start to finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I heard the sound of horses&#8217; hoofs, and I lit
a cigar and sat down to wait for the riders. There
were three of them, and the first glance showed me
Georgev was not among them. I sat smoking until
they rode up, then I rose slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the new men hired by the guide,
Georgev?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered one who appeared to be the
leader. &#8220;Is there a man named Karasch here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;An answer to my question. And I mean to have
it. This is the place, sure enough,&#8221; he said, turning
to his companions. &#8220;The tent and the hut;&#8221; and he
nodded toward each. &#8220;You&#8217;re Karasch, by your
description,&#8221; he said to Karasch. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the
prisoner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in charge here. Put your questions to me,&#8221;
I broke in, brusquely.</p>

<p>Resenting my tone, he looked at me more sharply
than before, and then laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you. You must be the man who rescued
our prisoner yesterday and shot Drago. You&#8217;ll
answer for that, I promise you; but I don&#8217;t want any
trouble. Your other men are on our side, you
know.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>&#8220;The man I shot lies in the tent there with a
broken leg. The prisoner you seek is in the cottage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s better,&#8221; he cried, with a sneering laugh.
&#8220;You know when you&#8217;re beaten, I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders as if indifferent.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re only two here, and Karasch has a broken
arm. So you&#8217;re not likely to have much trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the others?&#8221; he asked, suspiciously,
as if half fearing an ambush. &#8220;There were five of
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One, Andreas, lies out on the hills somewhere,
hurt riding after your comrade in the night. Petrov
and Gartski have gone to Lalwor, the hill village
yonder, seeking help to take the prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to come with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as it may be. But&mdash;we&#8217;ve no horses. Your
fool of a man killed ours last night, so that we
shouldn&#8217;t get away until you returned. But he
didn&#8217;t expect you so soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor did you, I expect. We came upon our
comrade on the hills by chance this morning, too ill
even to put a leg across a horse. It&#8217;s all that devil&#8217;s
work. He wishes he&#8217;d had no hand in the black
business, I can tell you. And so will you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can take her as soon as you like&mdash;the sooner
the better. She&#8217;s caused enough trouble here,&#8221; I
answered, and putting my cigar between my lips I
sat down again and lolled back as if in lazy indifference.</p>

<p>But my indifference was not even skin deep. My
object was to make them confident that there was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
sort of resistance to be expected, and every nerve
and sense in me was on the alert. I was making a
kind of corner in risks just then, and should need all
my wits to avoid being squeezed.</p>

<p>I was already fully resolved to use the three horses
thus fortunately brought within my reach, and my
first step was to get the present riders off their backs.
The second would be to keep them off; and the
third to put Mademoiselle, myself, and Karasch in
their places.</p>

<p>Karasch had said that the &#8220;witch&#8221; could bring
horses our way if she pleased; and when I looked
his way and saw his eyes glance meaningly from me
to the horses, I was half persuaded that he connected
their presence with some supernatural agency.</p>

<p>The three men spoke together a moment and then
the leader dismounted, handed the reins of his horse
to one of the others, and came toward me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay you mean to act all right and give up
the prisoner,&#8221; he said, bluntly; &#8220;but while we stay
here I&#8217;m going to make sure you can&#8217;t play any trick
upon us by tying your hands behind you. Stand
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke he signed to the other two, who
levelled their guns point blank at me.</p>

<p>It was a wholly unexpected turn and seemed to
spell crisis. Not seeing for the moment what to do,
I made no effort to rise, and he repeated his command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up,&#8221; he cried this time with an oath. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
no time to waste over you.&#8221;</p>

<small>A FIGHT FOR THE HORSES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I met the man&#8217;s bullying look and glanced from
him along the barrels of the guns which his companions
held pointed at me; and then sat up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see the necessity for it,&#8221; I said, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I see it, and mean to do it. Get up at
once, or you may find it difficult ever to rise again,&#8221;
he said, savagely.</p>

<p>I scrambled up leisurely, dropping my hand into
the pocket where I had my revolver, and my fingers
closed on it as I held it ready to shoot without drawing
it out.</p>

<p>One of the educational advantages of life in a
rough mining camp in the West is the use of a
revolver from the safe concealment of a pocket. This
man didn&#8217;t appear to understand the trick. I didn&#8217;t
want his blood on my hands; but I wasn&#8217;t going to
let him tie me up as he proposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn round,&#8221; he ordered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; I said, quite coolly. &#8220;If you
do this, how am I to know you&#8217;ll set me free again
when you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do as I tell you,&#8221; he cried savagely with another
oath.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, by God, no.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>This was from Karasch, very loudly and angrily
spoken, and the man turned from me to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I say. This was my doing from the first.
I set your man free to go and find you and bring you
here; but this shan&#8217;t be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The interruption was very timely, and I took advantage
by it to edge away until I was sheltered from
the guns by the leader&#8217;s body.</p>

<p>&#8220;What Karasch says is right enough. But you
need not say any more, Karasch. There won&#8217;t be
any more talk about binding me or anyone else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the Cross, but there will!&#8221; cried the leader
fiercely, and was turning to give an order to his companions
when I gripped him by the shoulder and
held him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move. You&#8217;re just in the line between
those two guns and me, and I can talk all the more
comfortably while you stay there.&#8221; Karasch laughed,
and the man tried in vain to wriggle out of my grip.
&#8220;I&#8217;m covering you all the time with my revolver,
and if you get away I shall shoot. You&#8217;ve been a
deal nearer death all the while than you thought,&#8221;
and I showed the ugly little muzzle above the edge
of my pocket.</p>

<p>The argument carried conviction. He ceased to
struggle, and changed colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell those men of yours to throw their guns on
the ground. They might go off by accident, and
I&#8217;m not taking that kind of risk any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated, and I showed him a bit more of my
pocket argument.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m accustomed to be obeyed pretty quickly.
Ask Karasch there,&#8221; I said, drily. Karasch laughed
again and swore.</p>

<p>The leader shouted the command over his shoulder,
and after some demur it was obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and pick the guns up, Karasch, and get this
man&#8217;s from his horse, and bring them to the tent,&#8221; I
said, and waited while he fetched them.</p>

<p>Then I took my hand from the leader&#8217;s shoulder
and stepped back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we shall all breathe a little more freely.
You see the kind of soft fool you&#8217;ve got to deal with
in me now, and you won&#8217;t make any more mistakes
of this kind. There are two ways of doing what
you&#8217;ve come to do&mdash;the rough and the smooth.
You&#8217;ve tried the rough and have run up against a
snag. Now we&#8217;ll go to the tent and talk over the
smooth way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us our prisoner, and we&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Karasch and I wish to go with you, and I
want to explain to you the little difficulty your man
has put in the way. Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d rather go straight to hell, you can,&#8221; I
exclaimed, fiercely. &#8220;Choose, and be quick about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come,&#8221; he said, sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can tell your men there we&#8217;re going to talk,
and that they may as well bait their horses. We may
be some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was getting to be quite an apt pupil. He
turned and gave the order, and the two men stepped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
from their saddles and growled to him to make haste.</p>

<p>I led him round the tent to the shed where the
three dead horses lay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night your man killed them. You see,
there are three of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there are three dead ones here, killed by
your man, and there are three live ones out there on
which you have just ridden up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean&mdash;what do you mean?&#8221; he
asked. He was beginning to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you propose to make up that loss to
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed uncomfortably. &#8220;You&#8217;re a cool
hand,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m cool enough just now,&#8221; I returned drily;
&#8220;and none the safer on that account, perhaps, to
fool with. How are you going to replace those three
horses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak out, and to hell with you,&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I propose an exchange, that&#8217;s all. You can have
these, and I&#8217;ll take yours and cry quits.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face was a study; rage battling with the conviction
of helplessness as he glared at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are three to two, I know; but we&#8217;re well
armed, and you have nothing but your knives. I
could put a bullet into you at this minute just as
easily, and much more surely than your men could
have shot me a while since.&#8221;</p>

<p>He started, and I saw his hand go stealing to his
sash.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t draw it if I were you,&#8221; I said quietly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>He took the advice and stood thinking in sore perplexity.</p>

<p>Then I made my first mistake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll treat you fairly. I shall pay you for the
horses, and will send you a couple of hundred gulden
for each of them, good Austrian money.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes lighted; and I read it for a sign of avarice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Six hundred gulden,&#8221; he said slowly and with
gusto. &#8220;Six hundred gulden. It is a large sum of
money; but we should be without horses;&#8221; and he
looked at me cunningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it a thousand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy to promise. As easy a thousand as ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I promise I can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May the Stone of the Sepulchre crush me if I
understand,&#8221; he exclaimed after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may help you to decide if I remind you I can
take the horses without even promising a single
gulden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And about the prisoner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She goes with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because she prefers to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that we lose the payment for her as well as
our horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much were you to be paid?&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused as if in doubt how much to ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five hundred gulden each. There are six of
us.&#8221; He watched me closely as he named the
amount.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three thousand gulden! She must be a prisoner
of importance. Who is she?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long road to Maglai and a difficult.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t answer my question. Your man
told mine she was a witch.&#8221; He laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;So we were told. Any tale was good enough to
listen to at that price. We can&#8217;t talk so glibly about
hundreds and thousands of gulden as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then <span class="allsmcap">YOU</span> don&#8217;t think she is a witch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe what I&#8217;m paid to believe&mdash;if the pay is
high enough. And no one would pay such a sum
for a mere witch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay you the three thousand gulden and the
six hundred as well, if you let me have the horses
quietly, and tell Karasch what you told me, that the
prisoner is no witch.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed again, and with sudden change to
earnest he shot a sharp look at me and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;How will you pay? Who are you to have such
a sum?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter who I am. I will send you the money
to any place and in any way you name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Horses are horses, and I know who is to pay for
the prisoner when we get to Maglai.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll increase the price four thousand gulden
if you give me the name of the man who has employed
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to serve you, if you really had money to
throw away like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m paying to avoid trouble and to gain information;
but I mean to have the horses in any case. You
can choose.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused to think again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>&#8220;You must be very rich. If I thought you&#8217;d pay,
I&#8217;d do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can take my word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look it,&#8221; he said doubtingly, and with
an accent of regret.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m through with the talk. Choose,&#8221; I answered,
shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to risk it, but I must speak to the
others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right enough. You can do that; but you
must bring the horses up to the side of the tent first.&#8221;</p>

<p>I let him go in front of me round the tent, and he
called to his companions to lead the horses over to
us. Karasch met them half way, and he and I tethered
them while the three men held a long and
animated discussion.</p>

<p>I told Karasch what had passed, emphasising what
the leader had said about the prisoner being no witch.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you said she had put a charm over your life,
Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I saw you were set on killing her. She
is no witch, but a prisoner of great importance. They
are to have three thousand gulden for taking her to
Maglai.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three thousand gulden!&#8221; he cried, his eyes wide
at the thought of such a sum. To him it was a fortune.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would anyone pay so much for a witch, Karasch?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man may be lying.&#8221;</p>

<p>I called to him, and he came and confirmed what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
he had said to me so stoutly that Karasch was convinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you agreed yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There would be no difficulty if we were sure of
you. Can he pay such a sum as four thousand
florins?&#8221; he asked Karasch, nodding his head toward
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a big fortune,&#8221; was the answer, with a shrug
of the shoulders. &#8220;But what he promises he always
does.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not a very convincing banker&#8217;s reference that at
the best; and the leader shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the point. It&#8217;s only a promise,&#8221; he said,
slowly, with a shake of the head. &#8220;Have you got
any of it here to give us now?&#8221; The question was
asked casually enough, as if it were no more than the
occasion warranted; but I saw more than that in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you I&#8217;d pay you afterwards. That&#8217;s the
last word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try what I can do then;&#8221; and with that he
went back to his companions, and the earnest conference
was resumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t trust him,&#8221; said Karasch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us get away quietly with the horses, and
we&#8217;ll trust to ourselves, Karasch,&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you pay such a sum as he named?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ten times the amount, Karasch; and ten
times that again if necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Lord of the Living!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;And yet you come here to the hills in this way!&#8221;</p>

<p>The three men had now apparently ended their
conference, and the leader came across to me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>&#8220;Two of us are agreed,&#8221; he said, as he reached me,
&#8220;but one will not without proof. Let me see our
comrade whom you shot. He must have a voice in
it too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is in the tent here,&#8221; I answered. We entered
it, and he went and knelt by the wounded man.</p>

<p>I did not trust him any more than did Karasch,
and, although I noticed nothing to rouse my suspicions,
I watched the two closely, and kept my
hand on the revolver in my pocket, and told Karasch
to watch the two outside.</p>

<p>So far all had gone as well as I could have wished.
We had the horses under our hands, and the men
were divided so that we could deal with them in turn
should they attempt to put up a fight.</p>

<p>Such a thing seemed far from their thoughts,
moreover. From the snatches of talk I heard, the
leader appeared to be arguing with his comrade, urging
him to agree, and answering the objections which
he raised. Words began to run high between them
presently, and at length the leader cursed the other
volubly for a fool and got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do nothing with this pig,&#8221; he exclaimed
angrily to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must settle your own matters, and be quick
about it,&#8221; I returned sharply.</p>

<p>I was getting very anxious now on account of
mademoiselle. She had been shut up in the cottage
all the time, and knowing nothing of what was passing
between the men and me it was easy to guess the
effect which so trying a suspense would have upon
her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8220;What can I do? He vows that if I yield to you
he will denounce me at Belgrade&mdash;idiot, pig, and fool
that he is,&#8221; he cried furiously, pacing the floor and
throwing his hands about. &#8220;We are equally divided
now, two to two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The money I shall pay would be a fortune for the
two who help me. The others would have no part
in earning it, and no right to share it. Two thousand
gulden, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had passed me, and at the words turned and
stood looking at me with an expression of consummate
cunning.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the devil to tempt a man,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me your help in this, and I&#8217;ll make your
share three thousand,&#8221; I said, in a low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Three thousand gulden,&#8221; he murmured under his
breath. &#8220;Three thousand gulden for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you shall have the horse we have and come
with us as guide to where we wish to go. You know
the country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every yard of it. Three thousand gulden!&#8221; He
murmured it almost caressingly, like a man dazed at
the prospect of such riches. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; he exclaimed,
and threw up his hand. &#8220;You&#8217;ll swear on
the cross to pay me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a couple of steps toward me as he spoke,
and I stepped back, not wishing him to come too
close.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he cried, and sent up a great shout.</p>

<p>There was a guttural sound behind me, and the
next instant I felt the burning sting of steel in my
flesh as the wounded man thrust a knife into my leg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
with a force and suddenness that made me stagger;
a clutch on my coat followed, which upset my balance
and drew me back all a-sprawl across him.</p>

<p>Only by the narrowest chance did I escape death
then&mdash;the chance that in falling I so hampered the
man that he could not deliver the second thrust for
which he had already lifted his knife. He struck at
me, but missed his aim. The blade pierced my coat
only, and, mercifully, I was unhurt. I was out of his
reach before he could strike again, and with a heavy
kick I put his arm out of action and sent the knife
flying across the tent while I shouted for Karasch.</p>

<p>It was all the work of an instant, and I was barely
on my legs before the leader rushed at me. My
fingers were still closed on my revolver and I fired,
but in the confusion missed him, and we grappled
one another in grim earnest.</p>

<p>He was a more powerful man than I, and although
I strove with all my strength and used every trick of
the wrestling ring that I knew, I could not shake him
off. He knew I was losing blood from the wound
in my leg; and he clung to me, pinning my arms to
my side, and waiting for my strength to give out, as
assuredly it must.</p>

<p>For some minute or two matters were thus; his
arms wrapped round me with the force of iron clamps,
fixing mine to my sides; his muscular body pressed,
straining against mine, and our faces so close that I
could feel his breath on me as it came through his
dilated nostrils.</p>

<p>Then chance was my friend once more. As I
writhed and staggered in my desperate efforts to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
shake off his terrible grip, and we tossed and swayed
in that grim, wild struggle, he caught his foot and
down we went crash to the ground, he undermost.
His grip relaxed for the instant, and with a frantic
effort I thrust myself free from him, and scrambling
up jumped out of his reach.</p>

<p>In a second I had the drop on him; and when he
regained his feet and faced me with a heavy club he
had picked up, he was looking down the barrel that
meant death.</p>

<p>If I hadn&#8217;t been a chicken-hearted fool I should
have shot him down on the spot; but instead I offered
him his life; and then, as if in contempt of my weakness,
Fortune deserted me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Throw your hands up, or I&#8217;ll put a bullet into
you,&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>He stood a second as if weighing the chances, and
then from outside came the noise of trouble. The
crash of breaking wood, a cry from the girl, the savage
growl of Chris, and an angry shout in Karasch&#8217;s
deep voice.</p>

<p>It was almost the last thing I knew of that fight.</p>

<p>Maddened by the sounds I sprang to rush from the
tent, when the wounded man, resourceful daredevil
as he was, made his last effort and flung his rug right
at my face.</p>

<p>The last thing I saw was the leader springing toward
me with his uplifted club; I fired at him; and the
same moment a blow on the head finished the fight,
and I went down stunned and senseless.</p>

<small>ESCAPE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>My first conscious sensation after the blow felled
me was as singular as it was unpleasant. I seemed
to be nothing but one huge head on which a hundred
invisible smiths were hammering with quick, rhythmic
blows, each of which gave me such excruciating
pain that I yearned to cry out to the impish torturers
to cease, but was tongue-tied and helpless.</p>

<p>After a time the throbbing sensation decreased in
violence; but while the sharpness of the pain of each
throb was less, it lasted longer, producing a deadening
sickening ache, which was equally intolerable.</p>

<p>Next I felt something touch my hand with a curiously
restless movement. The thing was sometimes
cold and damp, and at others warm and clinging,
with a touch now and then of roughness. I tried
to draw my hand away, but found it heavier than the
heaviest metal, so that I could not stir even a finger.
I shrank from the thing and shuddered; it filled me
with a sense of uncanny terror; and it appeared to
be many long hours to me before I found that it was
Chris, nosing and licking me and rubbing his head
against my hand.</p>

<p>I can recall to this day the rush of relief which this
discovery produced. If Chris was by my side, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
must be well. Just that one vague thought, without
any other conscious connection, followed by a sensation
of calm peaceful comfort.</p>

<p>I think I passed from semi-insensibility then into
sleep, for when I became conscious again, I was much
better. I was no longer all head; I could move my
hand to touch Chris, who still kept his watch over
me; and I heard his little whimper of pleasure at my
caress, as he took my fingers in his great mouth to
mumble them, as his manner was when very demonstrative
of his affection.</p>

<p>But I was content to lie quite still and soon afterwards
another and very different set of sensations
were started.</p>

<p>Someone came to my side, a fairy touch smoothed
the pillow under my head, a gentle, cool hand was laid
on my burning forehead, deft, quick fingers light as
gossamer removed the bandage on my head and
bathed it with water of deliciously refreshing coldness.</p>

<p>I heard a pitying sigh from tremulous lips as the
someone bent over me; I caught whispered words.
&#8220;It was for me;&#8221; and just when I was striving to
open my eyes, the lips were pressed swiftly and
gently to my brow.</p>

<p>It did more to soothe me, that one swift, gentle
touch, than all the waters of all the coldest rivers in
the world could have done; and although I felt like a
guilty hypocrite, I kept my eyes closed and my limbs
still in eager hope that another dose of the same
elixir might be administered.</p>

<p>But at the moment I felt the deft fingers start and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
tremble; the bathing recommenced a little more hurriedly;
and Chris growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, Chris, good dog,&#8221; whispered Mademoiselle.
&#8220;It&#8217;s only Karasch. Dear old dog,&#8221; and a
hand left my head to pat him, and in patting him, the
fingers touched mine and then lifted my hand with
ever so gentle a movement higher on to the bed.</p>

<p>A heavier tread approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he better?&#8221; It was Karasch&#8217;s gruff voice reduced
to a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been bathing his head,&#8221; was the reply.</p>

<p>I could have laughed in sheer ecstasy at the sweet
remembrance of part of that treatment. And she
called it &#8220;bathing.&#8221; But I did better than laugh. I
moved slightly and sighed. I must not show full
consciousness too soon after that &#8220;bathing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He moved then,&#8221; she said, with a start, in a tone
of pleasure, and I felt her bend hurriedly over me
again in the pause that followed.</p>

<p>Karasch broke the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not safe for you to stay any longer,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I came to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words opened the floodgates of my memory
to all that had occurred. I had forgotten everything;
but in a moment I understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you I should not leave him, Karasch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would wish it, I know. Your safety comes
first with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come where we can speak without fear of disturbing
him,&#8221; was the reply; and then I was left alone
with Chris.</p>

<p class="caption">&#8220;PUT THOSE GUNS DOWN!&#8221;<br />

<span class="imageright"><a href="#Page_348"><i>Page 348</i></a></span></p>

<p>I opened my eyes and looked about me, remembering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
things. I was in the tent close to where I
had fallen and they had brought the bed from the
cottage and placed me on it. I looked about for the
wounded man who had been the cause of my undoing,
but he was not there. Everything else was as it had
been before the trouble; and I wondered what had
happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Chris, old dog,&#8221; I said, putting out my
hand to pat him. He barked, not very loudly, but
the sound jarred my head with such a spasm of pain
that I hushed him; and as I was doing so, Mademoiselle
and Karasch came hurrying back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are better, Burgwan?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it all mean?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;I remember
I had a crack on the head.&#8221; I lifted my head,
though it took all I knew not to wince at the pain it
cost me, and put my hand to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will tell you everything presently. You
mustn&#8217;t talk yet. You are not strong enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me now. I am all right;&#8221; but I was glad
to yield to her hand and lay my head down again.
&#8220;Where are those men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All is well. You may be perfectly at ease,&#8221; she
said, soothingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the same day. You have been unconscious
from that blow on the head. I am so glad you are
better. But you must sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked across at Karasch, who was staring at me
with trouble in his eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>&#8220;Did we keep the horses?&#8221; I asked him; but
Mademoiselle replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. All is well. You can rest in perfect
safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>Karasch started to say something, but she checked
him with a glance and a gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any news of Petrov or Gartski?&#8221; I asked him;
and again she gave the answer for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will give us no trouble now, none at all,&#8221;
she said, with gentle firmness. &#8220;You can rest quite
assured.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Karasch wanted to speak and again she
stopped him just as before with a glance and a quick
gesture. I understood then.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to speak to Karasch alone,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you must not speak to him yet. There will
be plenty of time when you are better. Go away,
Karasch; you disturb Burgwan and excite him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lingered in hesitation and looked at me; and
she repeated her words dismissing him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes go, Karasch, and saddle the horses. Three
of them; and put together enough food for three of
us for a couple of days. And come and report the
moment you are ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Burgwan! You are mad,&#8221; cried Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am just beginning to be sane again. Go,
Karasch;&#8221; and without any more he left the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not attempt such folly. I will not
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find it both lonely and unsafe alone here
then.&#8221; She smiled at that, but tried to frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just like you. But you shall not take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
this risk. You are not fit to move from where you
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fit or unfit, I&#8217;m going. I read Karasch&#8217;s meaning
in his looks when you wouldn&#8217;t let him put it in
words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t attempt this, Burgwan. Please, please
don&#8217;t,&#8221; she cried with such sweet solicitude for me
and such complete indifference to her own danger
that I could not but be deeply moved.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would happen if Petrov or Gartski got
back with a crowd? I&#8217;m not strong enough just yet
to do any more fighting, but I am strong enough to
run away. And run away I&#8217;m going to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may kill you,&#8221; she murmured, despondently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it. I am getting stronger every
moment. See, I can sit up;&#8221; and I sat up and tried
to smile as if I enjoyed it, although my head seemed
almost to split in two with the effort. I can&#8217;t have
been very successful, for she winced and flinched as
though she herself were in suffering.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need rest and sleep&mdash;you must have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can sleep in the saddle. I&#8217;m an old hand at
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the jolting&mdash;oh, no, no, you shall not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The jolting won&#8217;t hurt me. I can shake my
head any old way now.&#8221; I shook it, and she and the
tent and the bed, the earth itself seemed to come
tumbling all about me in a bewildering rush of throbbing
pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;You nearly fainted then,&#8221; she cried. And I suppose
I did, for her voice sounded far off and her sorrow-filled
face and eyes were looking at me through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
a hazy film of distance. But I pulled myself together.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a bit weak, of course, but fit enough to ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Burgwan! You are going to do this madness for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; I said, my head clearing again. &#8220;I am
just running away because I&#8217;m afraid of what may
happen to me if I stay until Petrov and the other
fools get here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go by myself then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And desert me?&#8221; She lifted her hands with a
glance of protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make things so difficult,&#8221; she cried; then
with a change as a new thought occurred to her,
she added: &#8220;Beside, there is another reason for you
not to come with me. You are so weak we should
not be able to ride fast enough. You must see that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You fear I should hamper your escape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered stoutly, although her eyes
were contradicting her words and she dropped them
before my look. &#8220;You are not strong enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>I affected to believe the words and not the eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I give in. You must go alone then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not afraid to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And face the brutes who would come here? Do
you know why they are coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Karasch has told me all&mdash;his own belief
about me, and that of the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are brave, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were simple enough in themselves, but
I think she read in them something of what was in
my thoughts. She kept her head bent down and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
interlocked fingers worked nervously. Then she
looked up and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the risk you would run; why would
you do it?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>She threw off the more earnest feeling with a shrug
of the shoulders. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that there would
be any risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took this as her way of avoiding the channel into
which we were drifting. I smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would be so helpless, too, alone here,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221; catching at the word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes alone. I am afraid to stay and am going in
any case; if not with you, to hamper you, then by a
different road.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes clouded and she gave a little nervous
start. &#8220;I am punished; but I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t mean that,&#8221;
she said very slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. If I had not seen your real motive I
might have been content to stay. Nothing would
have mattered then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Burgwan!&#8221; Quick protest and some dismay
were in her tone; and the colour rushed to her
cheeks. &#8220;I will go and see if Karasch is ready,&#8221; she
added, and hurried away.</p>

<p>Had I said too much and offended her? I sat looking
after her some moments, in somewhat anxious
doubts and fears, and yet conscious of a strange feeling
of exhilaration.</p>

<p>Then with a sigh of perplexed discontent I threw
back the rug, rolled off the bed, and got on my feet.
I was abominably weak. My brain swam with every
movement I made, so that the place whirled about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
me until I must have nearly fainted. My leg was
stiff and painful where that treacherous brute had run
his knife into me. I remember looking at the bed
with a sort of feverish longing to get back on to
it almost impossible to resist as I clung to the tent
pole to steady myself and let my head clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got to be done, Chris, old man,&#8221; I said to the
old dog, who was standing by me; and after a struggle
resolution lent me strength, and I ventured at length
to do without the support of the pole and began to
limp slowly and painfully up and down. If there had
been no one but myself to think about I should have
given in and just lain down again to let happen what
might.</p>

<p>But the thought of Mademoiselle&#8217;s danger was
tonic enough to keep me going; and when I heard
Karasch and her outside, I managed to crawl to the
opening of the tent to meet them.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are ready, you see, Chris and I,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle said nothing, but the look in her
eyes was full of sweet sympathy and deep anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t look very fit,&#8221; I murmured.
I must have cut a sorry figure, indeed, I expect; my
clothes rough and torn, begrimed with dirt and
smeared here and there with blood, my head swathed
in a bandage, and my face pale to whiteness above
and blackened below with my sprouting beard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you could laugh at me. It would do me
a power of good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Laugh! Burgwan!&#8221; she said, her lips trembling.
She put out her hand. &#8220;Let me help you.
Lean on me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>&#8220;As if I wanted any help,&#8221; I laughed, and making
an effort, I started toward the horse I was to mount,
only to stagger badly after half a dozen steps. In a
moment her arm was under mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she exclaimed, in quick distress.</p>

<p>But I laughed. &#8220;Coward, to gloat over my fallen
pride. I only tripped over something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lean on me,&#8221; was all she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you really fit to travel, Burgwan?&#8221; asked
Karasch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get me on to the horse. I can ride when I can&#8217;t
walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you should stay here,&#8221; he declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, Karasch,&#8221; I returned, angrily. My
anger was at my own confounded weakness, but I
vented it on him. &#8220;The air will pull me together.&#8221;</p>

<p>I started again for the horse and this time reached
it, and with Karasch to help me, clambered into the
saddle.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle watched us almost breathlessly. If
my face was whiter than hers, I must have looked
bad indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got everything, Karasch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Food, water and arms;&#8221; and he pointed
to the horse he was to ride which was well laden.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help you up, Mademoiselle,&#8221; I said, with
a smile.</p>

<p>I seemed to be the only one of the three who could
raise a smile; for she looked preternaturally grave
and troubled as she mounted, and Karasch as though
he had never known a smile since he was born. But
then he was never much of a humorist.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>&#8220;The map and the compass, you have them?&#8221; I
asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have them,&#8221; said Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we can go. Wait, wait,&#8221; I exclaimed. &#8220;I
have forgotten something. I must get off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must have money. It&#8217;s in the hut. I must
get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t go in there,&#8221; she said, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The men are there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The men there?&#8221; I repeated dully, not understanding.
&#8220;What are they doing there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you were found in the tent we dared not
move you, so we brought the bed across to you and
put the wounded men in the cottage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course, you haven&#8217;t told me yet what
occurred. But my money is hidden there and we
must have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll fetch it if you tell us where to find it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Karasch?&#8221; I answered, doubtingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can trust him. I am sure of him,&#8221; she
declared with implied confidence. &#8220;He is a Serb
and would give his life for&mdash;for us. I would trust
him with mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is more there than he thinks. I&#8217;d rather
he didn&#8217;t see it all. Life is one thing, money&#8217;s another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me then. I will get it. He shall go with
me to the hut door, but shall not see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>I told her where to find it and she and Karasch
dismounted. I waited on my horse and while they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
were in the cottage I heard the report of a gun in
the distance.</p>

<p>Chris started up at the sound and barked in warning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the thing either, old dog.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t;
for unless I was too dizzy to guess right, it came
from the direction of Lalwor and threatened trouble.</p>

<p>They lingered an unnecessary time in the cottage
and every moment was now dangerous; so I rode up
to the door and called them. When they came out
Mademoiselle was trembling and looked scared and
ill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get them some water, Burgwan,&#8221; she
said, as she handed me the money. &#8220;I cannot leave
them like that. One of them&mdash;the one Chris flew
at&mdash;seems to be dying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We dare not stay;&#8221; and I told them of the gunshot
I had heard. &#8220;There will soon be enough here
to look after them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Karasch settled the matter with a promptness
which showed what he thought of the news. He
threw down the pannikin he carried and shut the
door of the hut.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; I said to her; and seeing we were both
so earnest, she gave way and we started.</p>

<p>We rode slowly and in silence down the ravine
until we reached the mouth of it, and made such
speed as we could down the mountain road.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot I want to ask; but as the easiest
pace for me is a canter, and as it&#8217;s the safest for us
all just now, we&#8217;ll hurry. We can talk afterwards,&#8221;
I said when we reached the level; and I urged my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
horse on until we were cantering briskly, the old
dog loping along close to me and looking up constantly
as though he was fully conscious that something
was very much amiss with me calling for the
utmost vigilance and guardianship on his part.</p>

<small>WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NIGHT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>We did not slacken speed until we had put some
miles between us and the camp; and although at first
I suffered abominable torture from the jolting, I had
to keep on, and after a time I found that the rush of
the cool air, acting as a kind of stimulating tonic
revived me. My head became gradually less painful
and my brain cleared.</p>

<p>If we had only been certain of our road I should
have had no serious misgivings as to the result. We
were all well mounted, and although the horses were
not fresh, yet they were quite fit to carry us the distance
we had to travel to reach the railway. But I
could only guess the road, picking the way by the
compass; and in that difficult and barren district
there was a constant risk that we should lose the way,
especially as we should have to ride through the
night.</p>

<p>It was almost evening when we left the camp, and
my intention was to ride as far and as fast as possible
while the daylight lasted and then rest until
the moon rose. We should then have six or seven
hours to ride before even the earliest peasants would
be astir, and in that time I calculated we should be
able to reach the frontier town of Samac, the terminus
of the line.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>The overpowering reason for travelling at night
was the fear that some attempt would be made at
pursuit. If Petrov and Gartski succeeded in bringing
any considerable party back to the camp from
Lalwor, they would learn from the men there of the
reward to be paid for getting Mademoiselle to
Maglai; and for any such sum as three thousand
gulden the average Bosnian peasant would leave all
he had in the world and go scrambling for a share
of it. And with greed to back up the superstitious
abhorrence of witchcraft, there was no telling what
would be done.</p>

<p>We were a party easily tracked, too. Two
wounded men, a woman, and a huge hound like Chris
would be readily remembered if once seen anywhere
at any time; and the night was thus the safest for us.</p>

<p>I kept all these thoughts to myself, however, and
pushed on as fast as practicable, although both
Mademoiselle and Karasch urged me more than once
to halt and rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must get on while the light lasts,&#8221; was my
answer. &#8220;We shall be compelled to rest when the
dark falls;&#8221; and the only time we slackened speed
was when the nature of the road compelled us.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would rest, Burgwan, if only for an
hour,&#8221; said Mademoiselle as we were walking the
horses up a hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not while the light lasts,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;The fretting
impatience to get on would do me more harm
than the rest would good. I am in little or no pain
now. Tell me what happened after I was knocked
over.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>&#8220;Karasch and Chris saved me. He says the man
in the tent with you shouted some signal at which
the two who were with him broke open the hut door.
Chris flew at them, pinned one man by the throat,
and the other who was close behind fell in the confusion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Chris,&#8221; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, good dog. Well, Karasch was on
the watch and as the man was getting up and drawing
his knife to attack Chris, Karasch rushed up and
knocked him senseless with a gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well played, Karasch. And then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was all, except that I had great difficulty in
making Chris loose his hold. His fury was really
awful to see. But he obeyed me, and Karasch and I
together bound the men and made them prisoners;
but both were badly hurt&mdash;especially the one Chris
mauled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the third man?&#8221; I asked, perplexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We found him shot in the tent, near you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I remembered then my shot at random just as I
was struck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but badly wounded; and we got him and the
man you took last night to the hut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it serves them all right; and the folk from
Lalwor will look after them. They meant killing
me. But it may make things uglier for us, and is
all the stronger reason for us to hurry on while the
light lasts;&#8221; and we pressed forward again.</p>

<p>Just when the gloom was deepening fast, my
policy of haste was justified.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>I had halted at a point where the road forked and,
in considerable doubt which way to ride, was
anxiously consulting my map when Chris put his
nose to the ground and whimpered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, Chris, good dog, steady,&#8221; I whispered;
and he knew he was to make no noise. &#8220;Someone
is about,&#8221; I said to Mademoiselle. We sat silent and
listened, and presently heard the throbbing of hoofs
from the direction we had been riding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two horses,&#8221; said Karasch, whose hearing was
very acute.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be nothing. Ride into the shadow of
those trees and let Karasch and Chris go with you,&#8221;
I said to Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you....&#8221; she began to object.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please do as I say and at once,&#8221; I interposed;
and I put my horse on to the grass under another
tree.</p>

<p>She did as I asked without further protest and
I waited for the newcomers. They caught sight of
me while still at some distance and checked their
horses first to a trot, and then to a walk.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are well come; I have lost my way,&#8221; I said
as they reached me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked one; and as the question
was put the other man laughed, and backed his horse
to a safe distance as he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Burgwan. We are all right;&#8221; and I recognised
the voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is Petrov?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You are wanted at the camp, Burgwan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
to explain things there. Where is the witch? May
the curse of God blight her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are the man, Burgwan, you must come
back with us,&#8221; put in the other man, who spoke with
an air of authority.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, must. There are some badly injured men
there; and the injured make strange charges against
you which must be explained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Captain Hanske, from Lalwor&mdash;the head
officer of the district under the Imperial Government.
You left the place with an escaped prisoner?
She must return with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A most disquieting turn, this Of all developments
possible, the least to my liking was a conflict
with the Austrian authorities.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am prepared to meet any charges,&#8221; I answered
firmly. &#8220;An attempt was made upon my life there,
and all I did was done in self-defence. But I cannot
return with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no option. You must do as I say and
at once.&#8221; He spoke in curt stern tone of a man
accustomed to be obeyed. I knew well enough the
fear in which the Austrian officials are held by the
Bosnians.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will see,&#8221; I answered, in quite as stiff a tone.
&#8220;I have first a reckoning to settle with Petrov
there;&#8221; and I wheeled my horse round and rode
toward him. But he did not wait for me to get near
him. He was off like the wind; as indeed I had
hoped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll carry the news back to the rest at the camp,&#8221;
he called over his shoulder, and he galloped back
along the road as though the devil himself were at
his heels. I listened to the dying sounds of his
horse&#8217;s hoofs with intense satisfaction, and went back
with a laugh to the official.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your character as a desperado is well established,&#8221;
he exclaimed drily and angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we can talk on equal terms,&#8221; said I, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I order you in the name of the Emperor to come
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I tell you, man to man, I shall do nothing
of the kind. I am no desperado, as I shall be easily
able to prove when necessary; but I have no time for
anything of the sort now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall accompany you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that also is impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you doing in the camp yonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My own business, merely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Also about my own business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are your papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have none to show you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I shall accompany you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. That I shall not allow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you dare to threaten me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are three roads here. One back to the
camp; one to the left there, and one to the right.
You are free to choose which you please and I will
take another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not leave you.&#8221; He was getting very
angry and dogged.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>&#8220;If you are armed you may perhaps force yourself
upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do as I say,&#8221; he answered, with just
enough hesitation to assure me he was not armed.
Then it occurred to me that it would be safer to get
him away from the place and to increase the distance
between him and the camp. It would be the more
difficult for Petrov and the rest to find him when they
returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle,&#8221; I called. She and Karasch came
out. &#8220;We are to have a companion. This gentleman
desires to ride with us. This is our road;&#8221; and
choosing that which led away to the right, I rode on
with her, leaving the official to follow.</p>

<p>She had overheard the conversation and questioned
me with some anxiety as to what I meant to
do. She went so far even as to suggest a return to
the camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my plans. It will all come right. I
should have left him at the fork of the road there
had I not thought it best to get him further away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I could probably satisfy him,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll deal with him in my own way, please,&#8221; was
my reply.</p>

<p>We plunged along at such pace as we could make
now that the darkness had deepened; but when we
could go no faster than a walk, and were, I reckoned,
some two miles from the cross roads, I called a halt.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to rest here, captain,&#8221; I said to
him, as we dismounted.</p>

<p>We three sat by the side of the road and while we
made a hasty meal I explained my plan to Karasch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
who was frankly frightened by the presence of the
official.</p>

<p>&#8220;The moon will be up in a couple of hours, Karasch,
and you must keep watch. I must sleep or I
shall not be fit to ride later. We are going to leave
that man here. If he dismounts, find the means to
turn his horse astray; if he does not, you must disable
the horse. But don&#8217;t shoot it except in the last
resource; for we don&#8217;t know who might hear the
shot. The man we shall just tie up to a tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is dangerous, Burgwan. He is an officer of
the Imperial Government,&#8221; said Karasch.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he were the Emperor of Austria himself, I
should do it in the plight we are in.&#8221;</p>

<p>I lay down. The excitement had kept me going;
but I was done now; utterly exhausted and worn
out; and despite the hazard of our position, I was
soon fast asleep. I was wakened by a loud, angry
cry from the Austrian. I could scarcely lift my
head for the throbbing in it; I ached in every joint
and muscle; and my leg was woefully stiff and painful
from that knife thrust; but I scrambled to my
feet in alarm and confusion at the noise.</p>

<p>I must have slept for some three hours; for the
moon was up and shining fitfully between the masses
of ragged threatening clouds which were scudding
across the face of the heavens. By the light I saw
the man struggling with Karasch and shouting with
a vigour that woke very dangerous echoes in the still
night. Mademoiselle was holding Chris, who was
growling ominously, and she was attempting to still
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>I went over to them and found that Karasch had
strapped the man&#8217;s legs tight together and was holding
on to the strap with his one arm while the
Austrian was fighting and wrestling to get free.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down, Chris. You may loose him, Mademoiselle,&#8221;
I said; and the good dog came instantly to
heel. &#8220;Stand from him, Karasch,&#8221; I called next.
&#8220;Now, sir, you must stop those cries; or I shall put
the dog on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is an outrage, an infernal outrage, and you
shall all suffer for it,&#8221; he cried, furiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s done by my orders. The outrage is that
you should endeavour to force yourself upon us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am doing my duty. I am a Government&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I choose not to believe you; that&#8217;s all there is to
it; and I take you to be a dirty spy set upon me by
that other coward, Petrov, who was with you. I am
going to tie your arms to your sides and leave you
here. We are both suffering from the injuries inflicted
by your accomplices; and if you resist, you
must settle matters with my dog here&mdash;and he makes
a rough fighter at the best of times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You infernal villain....&#8221; he spluttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chris.&#8221; The great dog came close up to him
and a fearsome brute he looked in the moonlight as
he eyed the captain and showed his fangs with an
angry snarl. &#8220;Now, Karasch.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ceased to struggle then and let Karasch fasten
him up securely; and after that we gagged him, and
finding a suitable place some distance from the road
we left him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s his horse?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>&#8220;I started him over the hills. Mademoiselle
helped me. I couldn&#8217;t have done it without her.
She got him from his horse talking with him, and I
got rid of the horse. It&#8217;ll probably go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may go to the devil for aught I care. But we
must be off without losing another moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt the necessity now. We had burnt our boats
with a vengeance in this treatment of the Austrian
captain; and if we were caught on Austrian territory
there might be a big bill to pay before we could
settle matters. It was not now Mademoiselle&#8217;s safety
only that depended upon our reaching Samac, but
our own also, and we pushed on as fast as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Karasch told me how cleverly you got that man
separated from his horse, Mademoiselle,&#8221; I said when
we were walking the horses up a steep hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not hear what I said to him?&#8221; she asked,
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said nothing to me if he did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He deserves what he has got; but it is a dangerous
thing in Bosnia to interfere with an Austrian
official.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you say to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I made the only offer I could. I told him I was
the cause of all the trouble, was alone responsible,
and offered to explain everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I see. You mean you offered to go back
with him, if he would let you go alone. It was like
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started and glanced quickly at me. &#8220;I did
not say that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>&#8220;No. But I know you, and where you are concerned
can make a guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would have been free, Burgwan; and I could
have cleared matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a fool, or he would have guessed and
accepted the offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Guessed what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the moment I woke I should have ridden
back to the camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Burgwan!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I should have left you in the lurch?
It&#8217;s not the way we treat women in England, or in
America.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t understand. I should have been
in no danger. Once under Austrian protection I
could have explained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Explained what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who I am. You have never asked me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not care. When you wish me to know, you
will tell me; and when I wish to know, I will ask. I
can wait. I know what you are&mdash;to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Either she did not catch the last words, for I had
dropped my voice, or she affected not to hear. She
said nothing and when we reached the top of the hill
we rattled on again quickly.</p>

<p>When we drew rein at the next hill we walked half
way to the top in silence and then she broke it
abruptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you if you wish, Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not. To me you are Mademoiselle: to you
I am Burgwan; and Mademoiselle and Burgwan we
can best remain, until we are out of this bother.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>&#8220;How far do you think we are from Samac?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought not to be more than a dozen miles at
most&mdash;but that&#8217;s not much more than a guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When we reach there, we shall part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be glad to be on the safe road to Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that another guess, Burgwan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s another guess, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s a good one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You would be an extraordinary woman if
it were not. I wish with all my heart we were safely
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I wish it, too,&#8221; she answered, with a gesture.
A long pause followed until she said, &#8220;Yes,
I do wish it. I had forgotten how ill you are and
how sorely you need rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it sounded as though I was thinking
of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to me; you never seem to think of yourself&mdash;at
least during our comradeship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like that word&mdash;comradeship. Thank you for
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been a strange one, Burgwan. How good
you have been. And I took you at first for a&mdash;a
peasant, and even once for a brigand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are worse folk in the world than peasants&mdash;or
brigands either for that matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What trouble I have brought to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have the more to laugh over when we
meet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall not meet again, Burgwan,&#8221; she said,
so seriously and deliberately that I thought I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
detect a touch of sadness. Perhaps I only hoped it,
and the hope cheated me. I answered lightly,</p>

<p>&#8220;One never knows. The world&#8217;s a small place
now. You might come to America some day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. That is impossible,&#8221; she interjected
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I might go to Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she exclaimed again in the same quick
tone. &#8220;That too must be impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible is a word we are going to wipe out of
the American dictionary,&#8221; I replied, with a smile.
&#8220;We shall see; but as we are at the top of the hill
we&#8217;ll hurry on to Samac&mdash;the first stage, whether
for America or Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned as if to say something, her face very
grave and earnest, but after a moment&#8217;s hesitation
shook up her reins and we cantered on.</p>

<p>But a good deal was to happen before we reached
Samac; the first stage, as I had so glibly named it.
We had some few miles of easy going when the path
became very difficult and branched suddenly in three
directions. I picked out that which, judging by the
compass, promised to lead us straight to Samac. But
instead of that, when we had followed it for an hour
or more we found it cut by a broad, swift-flowing
river.</p>

<p>The path led right down to the water&#8217;s edge and
rose from it on the other side; but the river was in
flood from the recent heavy rains, and the ford was
impassable. Karasch and I both tried to cross, on
horseback first and then on foot, but failed; and then
we rode along the bank searching for a fordable spot.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>But this only led us into worse disaster. We came
to a spot where another stream, itself as fierce and
swift and broad, joined the first. We were cut off
hopelessly.</p>

<p>We had lost precious hours in this way. It was
long past the dawn; and to make matters even worse
I could find no trace of the streams on the map anywhere
near Samac.</p>

<p>It was an awkward plight in all truth. To go on
was impossible; to stay where we were for the waters
to subside was useless; and yet to go back was only
to put ourselves once more on the road where we
might look for danger from those we knew to be in
pursuit of us. The hours we had thus wasted had
thrown away all the advantage gained by the night&#8217;s
riding.</p>

<p>Yet there was nothing else for it; and with a bitter
sigh and something stronger at the bad luck, I gave
the word, and we started to return.</p>

<small>FROM BAD TO WORSE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The crushing disappointment and the anxiety it
caused, following on the fatigue of the long ride,
aggravated the injury to my head so that I could
scarcely keep in the saddle. I had to cling to the
pommel to prevent myself from falling.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle was quick to see my condition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us rest, Burgwan,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we must push on. They may get ahead of
us. I shall be better again directly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am too tired,&#8221; she answered; and without waiting
to hear my protest, she slipped from her horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not do that,&#8221; I exclaimed, irritably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Karasch&#8217;s arm is bad too,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
it, Karasch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is paining me, Burgwan,&#8221; he declared
then. &#8220;I cannot go any further;&#8221; and he dismounted
and came to help me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll ride on and find the road and return,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; exclaimed Karasch, as he seized my horse&#8217;s
bridle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand away, Karasch,&#8221; I cried, angrily. I was
more like a fractious, obstinate child just then than
a reasoning man. I felt I was too weak to go on
and was angry with them both because I could not
hide it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>&#8220;You must get off, Burgwan,&#8221; he returned, firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll break your other arm if you don&#8217;t loose my
bridle, Karasch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll hold it. You won&#8217;t break mine, Burgwan,&#8221;
said Mademoiselle, taking it quickly. &#8220;Hold
my horse, Karasch. I am faint for want of food and
rest, Burgwan. Won&#8217;t you help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are only doing this because you think I&#8217;m
such a weak fool as not to be able to keep going,&#8221; I
declared, angrily. &#8220;Please to loose that bridle,
Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not until you break my arm, Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat still looking with a child&#8217;s sullen anger into
her clear, calm, resolute eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were a man....&#8221; I began and then
laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m a fool and that&#8217;s all there is to it.
I&#8217;ll get off&mdash;but I won&#8217;t forgive you. This is
mutiny.&#8221; I rolled from the saddle and was glad of
the help of Karasch&#8217;s sturdy arm. &#8220;You don&#8217;t seem
very weak, you coward,&#8221; I said, half in earnest, half
in jest.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the broken arm, Burgwan,&#8221; he replied,
as he helped me with the gentleness of a girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right and could ride fifty miles,&#8221; I protested
angrily as I sat down; and then in proof of it,
I fell back and fainted from sheer weakness.</p>

<p>When I came to myself Mademoiselle was bathing
my face and head, deep pity and care in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m horribly ashamed of myself,&#8221; I murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing you didn&#8217;t break my arm, Burgwan,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she said, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was angry. I wanted to go on. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;It was mutiny, you know. You feel better
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. I can sit up. Was I long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few minutes. Karasch has tethered the
horses and is getting us something to eat. Do you
know, I was never so hungry in my life before?&#8221; and
she laughed brightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in a desperate mess,&#8221; said I, gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;We should have been in a worse if we had gone
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rub it in. You got your own way, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant to have it; and I&#8217;m not going to put my
foot in the stirrup again until you have had something
to eat and have slept for at least two or three
hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a very masterful way of your own.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded and smiled to me. &#8220;But the point is
whether you are going to obey without more&mdash;mutiny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to take this for a kind of picnic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s breakfast at any rate,&#8221; she cried, as Karasch
came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it down here, Karasch, and get one of the
saddles to prop Burgwan up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can sit up without anything, I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who did you say was masterful?&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave in with a smile and a shrug of the shoulders
and let them arrange the saddle, and found it very
comfortable.</p>

<p>It was poor fare. Some hard biscuits, a tin of
preserved meat, and some water from the river; but
it could not have been enjoyed with more relish if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
it had been the best breakfast that the Waldorf-Astoria
chef could have sent up.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle&#8217;s cheerfulness in the strange and depressing
circumstances was positively dauntless. She
would see nothing but the brightest side of things.
We were lost on the hills; but then it would be so
much the more difficult for anyone to find us. The
food was rough, but we had plenty to last us for all
that day and part of the next. The loss of time
might be dangerous, but we all needed rest and
could take it without risk where we were. We did
not know where to look for the road to Samac, but
we should be sure to find a way somewhere. And
meanwhile we were getting stronger and so better
able to face the trouble.</p>

<p>Even Karasch&#8217;s stern face relaxed under her influence.
And as for me&mdash;well, I rolled over on the
soft grass when she told me, and having put old
Chris on the watch, went off to sleep as contentedly
as though her view of the position and not mine were
the true one.</p>

<p>I slept for some hours. I woke once and looked
round to find Karasch lying on his back at some distance,
snoring in a deep stertorous diapason; and
Mademoiselle curled up fast asleep peacefully with
Chris lying at her feet. The hot sun was pouring
down on the hills and crags around us; and I
stretched myself lazily and was soon off again in deep
refreshing slumber.</p>

<p>When I awoke again I was alone to my great surprise.
The horses were grazing near me tethered;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
but even Chris was away somewhere; and I sat up
wondering in some confusion what it meant.</p>

<p>A glance at my watch showed it was two hours
and more past noon and that I must have slept for
six or seven hours. I felt immensely refreshed. The
pain in my head was so slight as to be inconsiderable,
and although my leg was stiff, I could move about
freely.</p>

<p>Feeling in my pockets I found a couple of cigars
in my case, and lighted one to think over things. I
was smoking it with a rare relish when I saw Mademoiselle
coming from the direction of the river with
Chris in close attendance. How the old rascal had
taken to her! I went to meet them; and as I approached,
the dog came running to fawn upon me
and then rushed back to fawn upon her; and looked
from one to the other of us as though our comradeship,
as she had termed it, was just the loveliest thing
in the world to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chris seems to approve our comradeship, Mademoiselle,&#8221;
I said, marvelling how on earth she
managed to look so fresh and sweet after her rough-and-tumble
experiences during the last forty hours.
Her soft, glossy hair was as neatly arranged as
though she had just come from her room, her dress
was in such order that so far as I could see not a
thing was out of place.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been with me to the river on guard. I
had no idea it was so difficult to wash in a river, and
to do one&#8217;s hair out of doors and without a glass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been very successful. You put me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
shame sadly,&#8221; and I glanced down in dismay at myself.
&#8220;And you are so bright and sunny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is good news. Our luck has turned.
Karasch found a peasant who was crossing the hills
and is learning from him our route. They are on the
hill yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God for that,&#8221; I said, fervently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose it is good news,&#8221; she replied in a
tone which made me glance quickly at her. Then
she added, after a pause: &#8220;You look much better for
your rest, Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel a different man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kindly disposed toward masterful rebels?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and very grateful to one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were actually going to strike Karasch
when he held your bridle rein this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt like it, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he is afraid of you, Burgwan. It was you
who broke his arm, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He broke it in a fall.&#8221; She paused and glanced
at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me all about that fall, and what he meant
to do, if you hadn&#8217;t beaten him. It was for me you
risked your life in that fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Karasch ought to hold his tongue.&#8221;</p>

<p>We reached the spot where we had rested, and sat
down to wait for Karasch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been thinking this morning,&#8221; she said,
slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We all have some thinking to do before we are
out of our plight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You call this a plight,&#8221; and she smiled. &#8220;Why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
see what a lovely wild country it is. I could live in
these hills&mdash;live, I mean, in the sense of keen, rare
enjoyment. Look.&#8221; She pointed from one hill to
another with kindling eye. &#8220;The freedom of it.
The very air is different from all other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like some clean clothes,&#8221; I put in, flippantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t.&#8221; And she gestured and frowned. &#8220;I
want you to feel what it must be to me, and then to
think, as I was thinking a while since, what would
have been my fate&mdash;if it had not been for you. And
you call this a plight! It is like Heaven in comparison!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to exaggerate what I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not exaggerating it,&#8221; she replied deliberately.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t. I could not. You risked your life
for me and saved me. Not only when you rescued
me from the two men, but afterwards with Karasch;
and yet again afterwards when you were hurt. Could
I exaggerate that, Burgwan? Can I ever repay it?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was so earnest in the desire to make me feel
her gratitude and looked at me with such sweet
graciousness, that I came within an ace of telling her
how she could repay me. The very words rushed
to my lips only to be stayed by an effort as I dropped
my eyes before her. I could not speak of this while
she was still dependent upon my help.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a long time Karasch is,&#8221; I said clumsily
after a long pause, not knowing indeed what else to
say.</p>

<p>I felt her eyes still upon me. She made a slight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
gesture of dissatisfaction and her voice had an accent
of resentment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are anxious to get to your clean clothes
and all that they stand for&mdash;in exchange for this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not content with this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could be,&#8221; she murmured, with a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I suppose not. You haven&#8217;t the key.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can have no reason to be afraid to go back
to Belgrade. I know that, because at the camp you
were so anxious to start. Your sighs then were of
discontent because you couldn&#8217;t start at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember?&#8221; She smiled slowly, and then
grew serious. &#8220;No, it is not exactly fear, and yet&mdash;I
suppose in a way it is fear. It is certainly reluctance.
Oh, I see what you mean.&#8221; She broke off,
smiling very brightly this time. &#8220;That there may
be some reason connected with the cause of my capture
which threatens me: that I have committed
some offence or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, I don&#8217;t think anything of the sort,&#8221; I
interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not a criminal, not even a political criminal,
Burgwan&mdash;and not even a witch.&#8221; The smile
became a free and joyous laugh, and I joined in and
laughed also.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure about the witchcraft, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I were a witch I should know all about you
and I&mdash;yes, I should like to, and yet I would rather
not. We can be so frank while you are just Burgwan.
It is all so strange, this comradeship of ours.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
I shall never forget it. Shall you&mdash;even when you
get to those clean clothes that are so much in your
thoughts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not likely to change my thoughts even when
I change my clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a time Karasch is,&#8221; she laughed, throwing
back my own words at me. &#8220;Keeping you from the
tailor and the barber in this way!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is keeping you from Belgrade&mdash;a much more
serious matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind that&mdash;and yet I suppose I ought to.
But this is so delightful,&#8221; she cried, joyously.</p>

<p>&#8220;This?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This delicious freedom. This utter irresponsibility.
This Burgwan and Mademoiselle comradeship.
This being able to laugh at conventions and
snap one&#8217;s fingers in the face of restrictions&mdash;the
thousand petty &#8216;don&#8217;ts&#8217; and &#8216;mustn&#8217;ts&#8217; that edge
one in so, till one&#8217;s very breath has to be drawn with
restraint and every look and gesture fitted to some
occasion and empty etiquette. How I wish I was
just no more than a peasant girl! Oh, it is life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are plenty of them who would be glad to
change places with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know I am talking nonsense, and I daresay
I should grow tired of it all in a week or a month,
and sicken for the flummery and mummery again.
Besides, there might be no Burgwan like you and no
Chris in the picture, to feel safe with and trust. I
couldn&#8217;t do with only Karasch&#8217;s, could I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a very good fellow, and might make a very
good husband.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t, please. Now you&#8217;ve shattered the
dream, and made me wish for Belgrade and my
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Did she mean all I was ready to read into that sentence?
Was it intended as a warning lest another
than Karasch should presume? I was glad I had
held my tongue just before. When I did not reply,
she stooped and patted the dog and then laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you were my dog, Chris,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
shall get one just like him and call him Chris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like to change masters, Chris?&#8221; He
drew himself lazily across the grass at my words and
thrust his nose into my hand almost as if understanding
my question and answering it. &#8220;I will give him
to you if you like, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she shook her head. &#8220;No. No, no, no,&#8221; she
cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>She called him back to her side and caressed him
before she answered, and then spoke very slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I know why. I would rather have
him than anything in the world, but I couldn&#8217;t take
him. I&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t bear to have him, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may change your mind when you see him
next time.&#8221; She bent over him again and patted
him and let him lick her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I know what you mean, Burgwan&mdash;that
you think of coming some day to Belgrade. I
hope you never will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would not do. Oh, no, no, a thousand times
no. It is so difficult to explain. Here we are Burgwan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
and Mademoiselle; and there&mdash;well, for one
thing, you would have your clean clothes,&#8221; and she
broke off with a smile partly quizzical and partly of
dismay; and then added: &#8220;You would look for
Mademoiselle and would only find....&#8221; she
finished with a shake of the head and a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think I should be disappointed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not come, Burgwan. There would
be no Mademoiselle in Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chris may wish to see his successor. He is a
masterful dog, you know,&#8221; I said with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no jest, Burgwan. I wish you would
promise me not to come there. Ah, here comes
Karasch. Promise me, Burgwan;&#8221; and in her
eagerness she leant across and laid a hand on my arm,
the earnestness of her manner showing in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot promise,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>She drew her hand away with a gesture of impatience
and said, as she rose: &#8220;That is not like Burgwan.
The very mention of Belgrade has changed
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not changed me. I have always meant to go,&#8221;
I replied. As I got up Karasch reached us, and there
was no chance to say more.</p>

<p>He explained that the peasant had been pointing
out the way to him and was willing to lead us to the
proper road.</p>

<p>The horses were saddled at once and when they
were ready, I went to Mademoiselle, who had been
standing apart gazing at the rugged scenery with intense
enjoyment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we ready, Burgwan?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;Yes; we may start now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am almost sorry, I think,&#8221; she said, looking
about her wistfully. &#8220;But it&#8217;s all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except the comradeship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not even excepting that. You will get your
clean clothes and I all the conventions once more
and&mdash;all that they mean. I am ready;&#8221; and she
sighed.</p>

<p>I helped her into the saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it was only yesterday I would not let you
help me to mount. It seems a year ago,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You gave me that lesson in will power; but I beat
you this morning, Burgwan, and had my revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean about my going to Belgrade?&#8221; I
challenged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you will promise me then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I promised I should only break my word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Promise, and I will trust you&mdash;for the sake of
the comradeship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will not promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will force me to tell you things that will
compel you to promise. And it will be kinder not
to force me. Oh, so much kinder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You puzzle me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you promise? Burgwan?&#8221; she urged,
pleadingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that hard will of yours!&#8221; and wheeling her
horse round she rode off after Karasch and the guide,
leaving me to follow.</p>

<p>What did she mean? What could she tell that
would convince me a future meeting must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
avoided? What reason could there be on her side?
What could she think there might be on mine?
These and a hundred questions arising out of them
plagued me during the ride; and none of the answers
that suggested themselves could satisfy me.</p>

<p>But I was soon to have other matters for thought.
The guide put us in the right road for Samac, which
he told us was about fifteen miles distant through a
place called Poabja; and as soon as he had left us
we rattled over the ground at a sharp canter.</p>

<p>For one thing, I was very uneasy about the
Austrian officer whom we had treated so drastically
on the previous night. If he was found and liberated,
and raised a hue and cry after us there would
probably be some very awkward consequences; while
if he was not liberated soon, his very life might be
jeopardised. My intention was to send a search
party after him as soon as we reached a place where
that could be done without risk to ourselves; and I
was confident that my influence in Vienna was amply
sufficient to cause my explanation of the whole affair
to be accepted. But I could and would do nothing
until I was certain of Mademoiselle&#8217;s safety.</p>

<p>My anxiety increased when we reached the outside
of Poabja; and I kept a vigilant lookout for any
signs that the news of our arrival could have preceded
us. This was possible, of course. We had
strayed so far from the proper road and had stayed so
long in the hills that if Petrov and the rest from the
camp had followed us to where we had encountered
the Austrian, and had continued on the road to
Samac, they would pass through Poabja and we
might easily run up against some trouble, even without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
the complication arising out of the official&#8217;s rough
handling by us.</p>

<p>I soon noticed signs which I did not like. We
began to meet peasants and others on the road; and
I observed that while some of them did no more
than stare at us with close scrutiny, others started
away and turned their backs and made the sign of
the cross as we passed.</p>

<p>Karasch noticed this also; and when we met a
couple of men who behaved in this eccentric fashion,
he glanced from the men to Mademoiselle and from
her to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ill news has got ahead of us, Burgwan,&#8221; he said
to me in an undertone. &#8220;We had better avoid the
town. You saw that sign of the cross!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back and question the men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do we halt?&#8221; asked Mademoiselle, as Karasch
rode back.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must make certain of the right road,&#8221; I
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But is not this Poabja?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we know we are right. Samac is not half
a dozen miles beyond.&#8221;</p>

<p>Karasch came back wearing an anxious look.</p>

<p>&#8220;To avoid the town will cost a couple of leagues.
But I think we should take that route,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why avoid it? We have lost our way once,&#8221;
said Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>&#8220;We fear trouble. News of our coming is
known,&#8221; I explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean about the officer who tried to stop
us last night?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;No&mdash;that you are suspected of witchcraft.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed. &#8220;I have nothing to fear in Poabja.
I will find means to charm their anger into friendship;&#8221;
and she settled the question of route by shaking
her reins and cantering off toward the straggling
little place.</p>

<p>The approach lay up a long, winding hill, steep in
places, and as we rode up it the people came out from
the houses to gaze at us. Languid curiosity gave
way to close interest, and this in turn quickened into
some excitement. Men and women walked up the
hill abreast of us and some few ran on ahead.</p>

<p>Near the top of the hill stood an inn outside which
some half dozen saddle horses were hitched; and
when the riders came hurrying out I was scarcely surprised
to see Petrov among them talking and gesticulating
freely to his companions.</p>

<p>Men began to call then one to the other; the calls
were caught up on many sides, at first intermittently
but swelling gradually, as the crowd increased, into a
coherent cry which I recognised with deep misgivings.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Witch! The Witch! The Witch!&#8221;</p>

<p>I regretted that we had taken the risk; but Mademoiselle
only smiled even when the cries grew louder
and more angry and threatening, and hands were
raised in imprecations and revilings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forward,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;We must get through
them.&#8221; But to my dismay Mademoiselle hesitated.</p>

<p>Then Petrov and a man with him ran and placed
themselves in front of her and made a snatch at her
bridle rein. Karasch and I pushed forward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>&#8220;Stand back there,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That she devil can&#8217;t pass, Burgwan,&#8221; answered
Petrov.</p>

<p>I stretched forward and tore his grip from the rein
and flung him reeling back into the crowd.</p>

<p>A score of hands were raised in menace and the
cries of &#8220;The Witch! Death for the Witch!&#8221; went
up all around us; while the circle closed in ominously.
A stone was hurled and narrowly missed me and then
some dirt was thrown at Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>That was more than I was taking. If we were to
get through it would have to be by force. So I drew
my revolver and called to Karasch to do the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll shoot the first man who stops me,&#8221; I shouted,
and for a moment the men fell back before the
weapons. &#8220;Now is our chance. Gallop for all we&#8217;re
worth and we shall get through.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the luck was against us. A stone struck
Mademoiselle&#8217;s horse and he reared and plunged and
then fell. In a second she was in the grip of half a
dozen men and before Karasch and I could dismount
and get to her assistance we were separated from her
by the crowd and seized in our turn, the weapons
were struck from our hands and we were overpowered.</p>

<p>I was carried into a house close to the inn, my
hands and legs were bound and I was thrust into a
room and left to curse my folly for having ventured
into the place, to brood over the dangers to Mademoiselle,
and to breathe impotent vows of vengeance
against Petrov and everyone concerned in our capture.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br />


<small>AT POABJA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>For an hour and more I was left to gnash my
teeth in rage as I tore and struggled fruitlessly to
loosen the cords that bound me. In that hour I
endured the torments such as even hell itself could
not have surpassed. My violent struggles inflamed
the hurt to my head until it throbbed as if it would
split; but all mere physical pain was lost and deadened
in the surpassing agony of mind.</p>

<p>The thought of that sweet, pure girl in the power
of these crazy, superstitious fanatics was unendurable;
and had the torture continued longer it would
have driven me mad. Death threatened her every
minute she was in the hands of frenzied fools such as
they were; and a hundred possible ways in which they
might murder her occurred to me, each stimulating
the passion of my fear and anguish.</p>

<p>At length the door of my room was opened and
Petrov and another man entered. The sight of him
so maddened me that I strove to rise, bound though
I was, to wreak my fury upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No harm is meant to you, Burgwan,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>My answer was a volley of curses and threats so
vehement and furious that he started back in alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;No harm is meant to you,&#8221; he repeated.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>&#8220;Loose these cords then, to prove it,&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>His companion made as if to approach me when
Petrov held him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; he said, turning pale with fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter when you do it. You know
me, Petrov, and now mark this. If I find that the
least harm is done to Mademoiselle, I&#8217;ll make you
pay the price. And the price shall be your life. I&#8217;ll
hunt you down, if it costs me all I have in the world,
and when I find you, God have mercy on you, I won&#8217;t.
That I swear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a witch,&#8221; he said, doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You lie, you treacherous snake. And if you
value your dirty skin, see that no harm comes to
her.&#8221; It seemed to afford me some kind of relief to
abuse the beast.</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me so yourself,&#8221; he declared sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Loose these cords and say that again, and I&#8217;ll
tear your lying tongue out by the roots.&#8221; I must
have been beside myself to talk in this strain; but it
had its effect on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has come to no harm,&#8221; he said then.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may thank your God for that&mdash;if it&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; declared the other man. &#8220;We came
here to set you free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do it then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not while he threatens me,&#8221; put in Petrov,
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing about that. It&#8217;s the priest&#8217;s
orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pricked up my ears at that and the great crushing
weight of my fears began to lighten.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>&#8220;Say that again. And tell me what it means,&#8221; I
cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll only be taken to Maglai,&#8221; said Petrov.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say that again,&#8221; I repeated to his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what it means. I was told she
had confessed to being a witch and asked for the
priest, that she might repent and be shriven; and
then we were told to come to unbind you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the devil didn&#8217;t you say so then, when you
came in, and do it at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too violent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If all&#8217;s well with her, you can go to hell your own
way.&#8221; The relief from the strain was so intense I
felt almost hysterical with sudden joy, and I lay back
and laughed aloud. The two men stood staring at
me wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; asked Petrov&#8217;s companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you disobey the priest, my good fellow,&#8221; I interposed,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll see what he says to you, and I&#8217;ll
take care that he knows of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of replying, they left the room and fastened
the door behind them. I didn&#8217;t care now what they
did. All was well in the matter that had troubled
me. Mademoiselle was unharmed and they might
do with me as they pleased. I could trust myself to
get out of any trouble when once I was in communication
with my agents in Vienna.</p>

<p>All was well with her and the world was once more
a place to smile in.</p>

<p>Then I began to piece things together and to
figure out how such a change could have been
effected. Mademoiselle herself had found the means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
of doing it all. I recalled her phrase about charming
away the anger of the people at Poabja, and the
way in which she had cantered on fearlessly when
Karasch and I had counselled the other route to
avoid passing through the town. She must have
had a strong reason for her confidence. Brave as
she certainly was, she would not have faced such a
risk voluntarily unless she had had good grounds to
know she would pass the ordeal successfully.</p>

<p>Who was she? What influence was she, a Serb of
Belgrade, likely to have in that out-of-the-way Bosnian
village? On whom was that influence exercised?
The man said she had confessed to her
witchcraft and asked for the priest that she might
repent and be shriven. The priest it was who had
ordered my release, and the priest it must be, therefore,
through whom she had been able to clear herself.</p>

<p>How? It was an easy inference that he knew her
and that she had made the pretended confession so as
to get face to face with him. But why had she told
me nothing about him? &#8220;I have nothing to fear in
Poabja,&#8221; she had said; but not a word of the priest.
And then I thought I could see the reason. She did
not wish him to tell me who she was.</p>

<p>Had I known of him she knew I should have
sought him out first, or have sent for him, and the
secret would have been out before she could have
cautioned him to say nothing. Rather than that,
she had risked entering the place and facing the
crowd. Yet she had offered once to tell me about
herself. At that point the apparent inconsistency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
beat me; and the only guess I could make was that
she had anticipated getting to the priest without any
such trouble as that which had befallen us.</p>

<p>I was more than content to lie there thinking in
this way. It pleased me to let my fancy run at random
about her. I cared nothing who she was. To
me she was just Mademoiselle; and I wanted to know
no more. She had come into my life to stay; and
nothing that she could be, and nothing she could
ever do, would alter that all-supreme fact for me.</p>

<p>Two days before I had never seen her. Forty-eight
hours! But they had been forty-eight hours of
comradeship; and forty-eight years could not blot
out all that those hours had held for me, when I had
been in succession the peasant Burgwan, the brigand,
and then the trusted comrade and friend.</p>

<p>What had they held for her? I would have given
much to know. Daring, imperious, rebellious, yielding,
solicitous, and at last utterly content to trust as
she had been in turn; what feelings lay beneath the
surface? How was I to read that conversation on
the hillside? Why was she so resolute that our
parting was to spell permanent separation; that I
must not go to Belgrade, and must never seek to
see her again?</p>

<p>I had not given the promise sought, of course. I
would not give it. What would she say if I told her
that my visit to Belgrade, in my character as financier
was already arranged and that my hand had already
been felt in that unrestful little centre of Balkan
policy. Probably she knew nothing and cared
little about Balkan politics or finance; and I was indulging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
in half a hundred conjectures of her reason
for my keeping away from Belgrade when the two
men entered my room and brought me a note.</p>

<p>&#8220;From the priest,&#8221; said one of them.</p>

<p>But it was not. It was from her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;All my troubles are over and you may be quite at
rest about me. Give your word not to hurt the man
Petrov. I ask this. I ask, too, that you will consent
to remain where you are for two hours longer.
Will you do this&mdash;a last favour? For all you have
done for me I cannot thank you; I can only remember.
Do you think me graceless and a churl if I say
our comradeship is over and if I go without seeing
you? I can only say in excuse, I must. To Burgwan from</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I am taking Chris. You said I should alter my
mind. I have. I will treat him as what he has
been&mdash;one of the comrades.&#8221;</p>

<p>I read the letter two or three times. At first with
feelings in which chilling despair, a sense of ineffable
loss, and intensely bitter regret overpowered me. It
stung me like a blow in the face that she could go
like this, without even a touch of hands, or a parting
glance. She was safe, and I was nothing, or less
than nothing to her. But at the second and third
reading very different thoughts were stirred. A hope
sprang to life in my heart great and wild enough to
dazzle and bewilder me.</p>

<p>Could it be, not that she cared nothing for me but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
that she feared for herself in the hour of parting?
Dared I hope that? Did she fear that feelings, which
she was all unwilling to shew, would force themselves
out in despite of her efforts in the moment of
parting? Was it from that part of herself, from her
heart, that she was thus running away, and not only
from me? I prayed that it might be so.</p>

<p>Then a colder mood followed, cold enough to
freeze that hope, at the prompting of judgment. She
knew nothing of me. To her I was just Burgwan;
at first peasant, then, on my own admission, an American
in such sordid surroundings as might well make
her deem me a mere adventurer. With that belief
in her mind, she might well be at a loss how to part
from me&mdash;what to say and do, and whether she
ought not to make me some reward for what I had
done.</p>

<p>The thought bit like a live acid with its intolerable
sting; and yet my judgment found reason after
reason in support of it. I alternated between a hot
desire to rush out there and then and seek her, and a
stolid, dogged resolve to let her go and to live down
the mad desire to see her and explain all.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are to give us some answer,&#8221; said the man
who had brought the letter. The two had been
watching me in silence during those few distraction-filled
minutes. &#8220;An answer concerning Petrov
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are safe from me, Petrov,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;I
will let you go, but keep out of my way for the
future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant no harm, Burgwan, on my soul none to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
you. I did what I did for you,&#8221; he said, and stooped
to cut the cords that bound my feet. &#8220;I did wrong
and am sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was an idiot, but he couldn&#8217;t help that; and I
let him free my hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get me some paper,&#8221; I said, and he hurried away
and returned with it. My hands were too numbed
from the cords and the efforts I had made to release
myself for me to be able to do more than scratch
senseless hieroglyphics on the paper. I could
scarcely hold the pencil, indeed, and he and the other
man chafed them until the blood was set in circulation.</p>

<p>Even after some minutes of this I could only write
in large, uncouth letters&mdash;a sort of illiterate scrawl
which was no more than a caricature of my handwriting.
But time was pressing. Mademoiselle
might be gone before my letter could reach her, so
I wrote as best I could.</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree on condition that you see me. Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>I spelt my name as she had been accustomed to
pronounce it; and having sent Petrov to deliver it,
I ordered the other man to get me some food and
milk.</p>

<p>I had no appetite; but I had eaten nothing for many
hours and knew I must keep up my strength; so I
forced myself to take it. The milk was grateful
enough, for I was feverish and consumed with thirst.
But all the time I was waiting impatiently for
Petrov&#8217;s return with the answer to my letter; and as
soon as I had finished the meal I paced up and down
the low, narrow room feeling like a caged beast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>But my resolve was fixed. She should not go
without my seeing her; and when minute after minute
passed and Petrov did not return, I could barely
keep within the house, and was seized with a fierce
longing to rush off to the priest&#8217;s house and find her.</p>

<p>At length the suspense and restraint passed endurance,
and I went to the door and shouted for someone.
The man who had been with Petrov came in
response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the priest who gave you your orders?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father Michel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does he live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the side of his church at the end of the long
street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is it? How long should it take to go
there and return?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man should have been back before now. I
suppose they have kept him while an answer was
written.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my house. I keep the inn next door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is my horse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your companion has them all. Karasch is his
name, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>I had forgotten all about Karasch in my anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he and the horses?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have been fed in my stables. There&#8217;s a
bill to pay,&#8221; he added, as though that was the most
important feature in the whole case. I suppose it
was to him. I gave him a gold piece and told him
to keep the change, and so made a friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you lead me to the priest&#8217;s house?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>&#8220;Of course I can, at need. But I was told you
were going to remain here a couple of hours. It is
nothing to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See if Petrov is coming,&#8221; I said next. His words
had recalled Mademoiselle&#8217;s letter; and I was still
anxious to do what she had asked.</p>

<p>He went out and after a minute or two, returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is coming down the hill now,&#8221; he announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be at hand if you want me,&#8221; he answered,
and shut the door behind him.</p>

<p>Petrov came a minute later and had a letter.</p>

<p>I tore it open with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you wait for me? Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of intense relief, and looking up,
caught Petrov&#8217;s eyes bent upon me. As he met my
look he lowered his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go,&#8221; I said, curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to serve you still, Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no need for you. Go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is money due to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221;</p>

<p>He named a sum and I gave it him, saying that
rightfully he had forfeited it by his disobedience.
He counted it slowly as if to make sure it was right.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to serve you still, Burgwan,&#8221; he repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you I have no need for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About that Austrian Government officer, Burgwan,
Captain Hanske?&#8221; It was said with sly suggestiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he? He stayed with you and has not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
been seen again. No one but me knows you saw
him last.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you threatening me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I want to serve you. Is he dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You insolent dog. No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do with him? I&#8217;ve kept my lips
closed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Closed or open it&#8217;s all one to me. Say what you
like to whom you like. But get away from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to serve you, Burgwan. You can pay.
Not only about him, but about that, too;&#8221; and he
pointed to the letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a long time gone, wasn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; His manner and tone were full of suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can serve you. I can help you to get those
three thousand gulden!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three thousand gulden!&#8221; I exclaimed, utterly
at a loss for his meaning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the three thousand waiting to be paid at
Maglai.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I understood and burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re making a pretty considerable ass
of yourself, Petrov; but I&#8217;ll listen to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You meant to take her to Maglai, you and Karasch.
You knew she was no witch and meant to
earn the reward. Well, I can help you now, if you&#8217;ll
give me my share.&#8221;</p>

<p>My first impulse was to kick him out of the room
and I started angrily to obey it; but then a very different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
thought stopped me. He knew something
that I ought to know. He took me for a scoundrel
enough to betray Mademoiselle in this way and
thought he could sell this knowledge of his at the
price of a share in the reward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why were you so long away?&#8221; I asked, seizing
on the vital point.</p>

<p>&#8220;What share am I to have?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Half the reward when I receive it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You swear that?&#8221; he asked slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what you know,&#8221; I cried, sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she say she&#8217;ll come here?&#8221; he asked, pointing
again at the note in my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah. She&#8217;s gone and if we&#8217;re to get her into our
possession again we shall have to be quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone? Where?&#8221; I exclaimed, aghast at the
check.</p>

<p>He threw up his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;To Samac. But you haven&#8217;t taken that oath
about my share.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You infernal villain. Do you think I mean to
harm her? Out of the way;&#8221; and dashing him
aside, I called for the other man and told him I must
have my horse at once.</p>

<p>Then I turned back to Petrov.</p>

<p>&#8220;How long has she been gone?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t say. I&#8217;ve lied to you, Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here;&#8221; and I took out some gold pieces. &#8220;These
are yours if you tell the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gone on the road to Samac, Burgwan, in
a carriage which the priest found for her, and has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
about half an hour&#8217;s start. They kept me from coming
back to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Karasch came up then with his horse and mine,
and in a moment I was in the saddle dashing in hot
haste up the winding street.</p>

<small>TO SAMAC.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Many of the village folk were still lounging in the
street and the clatter of the horses&#8217; heels brought out
more to gape and stare in wonderment as we clattered past.
We were nearing the end of the place
when I caught sight of a church with a mean-looking
presbytery by the side.</p>

<p>I checked my horse, rode to it, and asked for Father
Michel. A tall white-haired priest came out; kind-faced,
with remarkable eyes almost black, under black
brows. A man to trust certainly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are Father Michel?&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer he turned his searching eyes upon me,
paused and said: &#8220;You will be Burgwan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And you know why I come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I was in the act of coming to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she here?&#8221; I did not know how to speak of
Mademoiselle; but he understood instantly. He
patted my horse&#8217;s neck and looked up with sympathy
in his manner and glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will let me speak with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she here?&#8221; I repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;She wished me to see you. We arranged that she
should go and that I should give you her messages.
You will come into my house?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>&#8220;No, I cannot wait. She is gone to Samac. I
shall ride after her. I must see her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are suffering,&#8221; he said, with that soothing
comfort-offering air which is the priceless possession
of many women and some good men. &#8220;You will
let me give you her messages?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot wait,&#8221; I said again; and yet I lingered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it ease your own pain to make her suffer?&#8221;
The question made me wince; and I shirked the answer
to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;She <i>has</i> gone to Samac?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she has driven to Samac. There is plenty
of time for you to listen to me and then to overtake
her before she can leave there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was to come to me,&#8221; I said, with a glance of
doubt at this. It might be another ruse. He saw the
doubt instantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may believe me. I do not wish to detain
you if you prefer to go, and should not stoop to a
trick.&#8221; He stepped back and waved his hand as if
to signify I was free to go, and added: &#8220;It is only for
her sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>He knew the strength such a plea would have for
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must see her. I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw up his hands with a gesture of pain.</p>

<p>I half wheeled my horse round to start and then
checked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did she go in this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he turned those wonderful eyes of his upon
me, and answered slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you do not know I must not tell you. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
has gone out of your life altogether&mdash;altogether. It
is her own doing; her own will and wish and doing.
Let her go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not,&#8221; I exclaimed almost fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have patience and the strength of a man, Burgwan.
You have acted nobly to her, offering your life
in her defence. She cannot repay you. She knows
that, and I know it. Add chivalry to your courage,
and spare her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She told me to wait for her&mdash;in that letter, I
mean; and yet before it was in my hands, she had
gone away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sweetest pleasure in life as well as the noblest
quality in man is self-denial, Burgwan; and in your
case it is real prudence and wisdom as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she bade me wait for her,&#8221; I repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in Poabja, Burgwan. She bade me get from
you your name and the means of communicating with
you if ever&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it was a mere trick of words,&#8221; I cried with
angry unreason. &#8220;I shall follow her;&#8221; and without
waiting for him to reply I rode off quickly. I think
I was afraid to trust myself longer with him; afraid
lest he should prevail with me; afraid lest the fierce
consuming desire to look once more upon her face
should be chilled by the appeals to my better nature
which he knew how to make so shrewdly.</p>

<p>Already he had made me conscious of the stubborn
selfishness of my purpose; and as I galloped along,
I sought to stifle the feeling with specious palliation
and anger. She had no right to treat me in this
way. I had done nothing and said nothing to deserve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
it. She had run away under the cover of a mere trick
and ruse. And so on.</p>

<p>But I could not shake off the impression of the
priest&#8217;s words, &#8220;Will it ease your own pain to make
her suffer?&#8221; The question haunted me. I could
find no answer to it in my own thoughts, just as I had
found none in speaking with him. Out of it came
the chilling conviction that the part I was playing
was the part of the coward.</p>

<p>I was forcing myself upon her in face of her remonstrance
and pleading. &#8220;Her own will and wish
and doing.&#8221; What was I but a coward to try and
force her. The very air took up the cry of coward;
and the rhythm of my horse&#8217;s hoofs seemed to echo
it at every throbbing stride.</p>

<p>But I knitted my brows and set my teeth and held
on. I must see her again. I would. It was my passion
that urged me. I would see her, let the world
cry shame upon me for my cowardice. And I dug
my heels into my horse&#8217;s flanks in my distraction
and rushed along up hill and down alike at a mad,
reckless speed.</p>

<p>Fast as I rode, however, I could not outpace that
thought of cowardice. It gained upon me, little by
little; now to be flung aside in anger, only to return
to chill me until I hated the thing I was doing and
had to put forth every effort of my selfish desire to
prevent myself checking the horse and turning back
to seek some other means to my end.</p>

<p>If it was really to cause her suffering, after what
she had gone through, how dared I go on? What
would she think of me? She had trusted to me in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
that time of peril with the implicit trust of a child.
Thank God I had been able to stand between her and
her danger, and we had come through it together to
safety. And now I was so madly selfish that I could
not be man enough to spare her from this pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot thank you; I can only remember,&#8221; she
had written. And here was I bent upon blotting the
memory with this slur of my own crude, brutal selfishness.
Was this what she would look for in her
comrade? Was it what she had the right to expect?
How would the act look when she came afterwards
to remember?</p>

<p>Unwittingly I checked my horse. I was a coward
now of another kind. I was afraid to satisfy my own
desire; afraid to mar the memory she would have
of our comradeship; afraid to meet the look of reproach
I knew would be in her eyes at the sight of
me.</p>

<p>My horse, glad enough to ease his speed, fell into
a walking pace, and I let the reins drop on his neck
as I hung my head in sheer dejection. Karasch
came to my side in astonishment then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is anything the matter, Burgwan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing that you can help, Karasch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to Samac, are we not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;and don&#8217;t care. Don&#8217;t worry me
with your questions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mademoiselle has been taken there, hasn&#8217;t she?
Are you not going to her help?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has gone there of her own will and wish. She
is quite safe; you need have no fears for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know she is safe?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>&#8220;The priest told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The priest!&#8221; he exclaimed, with scant respect.
&#8220;I should like to know it for myself and trust my
own eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>I started and instinctively gathered up the reins
again. What if she was not safe after all. Could
the whole thing at Poabja be just a trick to get her
from me?</p>

<p>I laughed suddenly; so suddenly that Karasch
started and looked at me in surprise and some alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I see the devil if I see a reason for laughing.&#8221;</p>

<p>But I did. I was laughing at the effect his words
had had on me&mdash;at the tempting pretext they offered
for continuing the journey. I could pretend that I
was in doubt about her safety, and that that was the
reason for my riding after her. I played with the
thought; and then laughed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool, Karasch. She is quite safe, I tell
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ridden out thus far then at a wild
gallop in order to see how dusty the roads are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s about how it looks,&#8221; I laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That blow on your head has hurt you more than
we thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t my head this time,&#8221; I said drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your leg, you mean? Or did they do anything
to you at Poabja?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it all happened at Poabja, Karasch. I must
go back there and see that priest again;&#8221; and I pulled
my horse up and turned him. I would have given
much to have taken Karasch&#8217;s view and have ridden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
on, but the thought of Mademoiselle&#8217;s eyes stopped
me. Even if I persuaded myself, I could not tell the
lie to her.</p>

<p>Karasch sat facing me stolidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are ill, Burgwan, or it wouldn&#8217;t be like this
with you. Go back to Poabja and I&#8217;ll seek you
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Where are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Samac. I will not desert her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grim irony of this was too much for me and
I smiled. Here was I, consumed with intense longing
to go to her and compelled to hold myself back
with a curb of iron&mdash;and to Karasch my act seemed
no more than paltry cowardice and desertion. My
smile seemed to anger him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not been so free with your laughter
till now,&#8221; he said, curtly, &#8220;and I see no cause for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I laugh it is not for joy, Karasch; but you
don&#8217;t understand. Do as you say. Go on to Samac
and bring me any news you may find there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right. I don&#8217;t understand. But you
had better ride on with me. If you are really ill,
we are nearer to Samac than Poabja; and if there is
news you ought to know, it may mean a grievous
waste of time to have to ride back to Poabja.&#8221;</p>

<p>How aptly the plea fitted with my desires. It was
true, too. She might, after all, have need of me.
There was just the chance that matters had been misrepresented.
It could do no harm for me to be in
Samac. I need not see her even if I went there.</p>

<p>Karasch watched me closely as I sat letting these
thoughts and others of the kind influence me; and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
believed that he was persuading me and bringing me
back to my right mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be very little use without you, Burgwan,
if there is really more trouble. We ought to make
sure. We should be cowards to desert her now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder which way the real coward would decide
to go, Karasch. For the life of me I don&#8217;t
know;&#8221; but I wheeled my horse round again and we
rode on toward Samac.</p>

<p>After all I was not now going to see her, I said
to myself. I would just make sure, as Karasch had
suggested, that all was well with her, and then hide
myself until she had left. That was how I shut the
door and turned the key against those uncomfortable
words of the priest about chivalry and self-denial.
After all it was perfectly consistent with chivalry to
assure myself of her safety to the last minute, and
yet keep away; while as for self-denial that would be
all the greater if I did not see her when close to her
at Samac than if I remained five miles off at Poabja.</p>

<p>Yet in my heart I knew perfectly well I was going
to see her. I was going to play the coward and to
force myself upon her at the risk of causing her pain;
aye, even with the prospect of losing her esteem.</p>

<p>I did not ride so fast now, and thus Karasch could
talk. He wanted to talk about her; what we should
do when we reached Samac. But I could not stand
that, and each time he began I mumbled some incoherent
reply and struck my heels into my horse
to get away from him; and at last he gave up the
attempt.</p>

<p>I knew that I was going to ride straight up to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
railway depot where I should find her; but I would
not admit this even to myself yet, and certainly would
not put it into plain words.</p>

<p>Presently he chose another topic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you thought about that Austrian Government
officer, Burgwan?&#8221; he asked, with some evidence
of uneasiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a good deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do about it? He can&#8217;t
be left where we tied him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like to go and find him?&#8221; I asked,
with a grin. It pleased me to tease him in the mood
I was in.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, by the God of the living, not for a fortune.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we leave him to die then?&#8221; I put the question
angrily, as if rebuking him for callousness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go yourself,&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be murder to leave him. There will be
a big reward offered for his murderers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one knows about it,&#8221; he growled again, uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Petrov does. He spoke of it in Poabja
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The blight of hell blind him for a cursed pig,&#8221;
he exclaimed with sudden savageness.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much chance of that before he can
say what he knows, Karasch. I mean to leave the
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>He started so violently that he checked his horse,
and when he rode up again he looked at me searchingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>&#8220;Are you trying me?&#8221; he asked, half fiercely half
in doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s for the judge to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He chewed this answer for a while in gloomy
silence; then he uttered one of his quaint oaths into
his black beard, and his face cleared.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a time when I should have thought
you ready to do even that and worse. I don&#8217;t now.&#8221;</p>

<p>That beat me. &#8220;Then if I can&#8217;t fool you I may as
well say what I mean to do,&#8221; I said. &#8220;Petrov knows
the point where we met last night; and I shall send
back to the priest at Poabja enough money to pay
for a search party being sent out under Petrov&#8217;s
guidance to find the officer. I marked the spot where
we left him and can describe it clearly enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the men at the camp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall send money for them to be cared for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be a pretty mess of trouble when that
officer once gives tongue&mdash;a hue and cry will be
raised for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will have to be a loud one to reach us. We
shall be far enough away by that time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pondered this answer in his deliberate way
when puzzled; and then lifted his head and looked
across at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;We?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I say I should be out of the country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you did; but&mdash;&#8221; he shook his head, doubtingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you think I should leave you behind,
Karasch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said; and urging his horse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
he added: &#8220;Shall we get on? There&#8217;s Samac in
sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rode ahead of me without another word until
we were just at the entrance to the town, when he
stopped and waited for me. His face was pale and
set. He had been thinking earnestly, and was unusually
disturbed and nervous.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a man, Burgwan, right to the heart. I
can&#8217;t say how glad I am you beat me in that fight;
and I&#8217;d never been beaten before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Karasch; don&#8217;t say any more;&#8221; and
I stretched out my hand to him. He took it and held
it as he answered almost emotionally:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a better man than I am every way, by the
living God. I&#8217;m only a dog beside you, but I&#8217;ll serve
you like a dog, if you&#8217;ll let me.&#8221; His earnestness
amounted to passion now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not like a dog, Karasch; not even like our good
Chris; but like a man and a friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not fit to be your friend; I&#8217;m only a peasant
when I&#8217;m nothing worse; but I&#8217;ll be your man, God
send the chance to prove it. And now you lead and
I follow.&#8221; He let my hand drop and fell behind and
nothing would induce him to ride farther at my side.</p>

<p>I was deeply touched by his earnestness. I had
had many men offer themselves to me before&mdash;a man
with such wealth as I possessed always will have.
But this man was moved by no thought of personal
advantage. It was to Burgwan, the man, he pledged
himself, not to the millionaire; and I prized the offer
for that reason alone.</p>

<p>But this act in falling behind and leaving me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
take the lead just at that juncture was not without its
embarrassment. It made the pretence of having followed
his lead to Samac the more difficult to keep
up; and I rode through the town in no little doubt
and hesitation what to do.</p>

<p>Inclination drew me straight to the station, and
Mademoiselle; while that pricking consciousness that
was doing a cowardly thing warned me away.</p>

<p>But love and doggedness triumphed. I had come
too far to retreat; and now that I was so near to her
I lacked the pluck to keep away from her.</p>

<p>I did what I had felt I should do. I rode straight
to the station and, giving my horse into Karasch&#8217;s
charge, I entered it to look for her.</p>

<p>She was there, sitting in the miserable waiting-room,
dejected and sorrowful, and bending over
Chris as he squatted on his haunches beside her, with
his great head in her lap.</p>

<p>He recognised my step and with a whimper of
pleasure, started up and rushed to me, fawning upon
me with such delight that I had to check him.</p>

<p>But Mademoiselle turned pale as she saw me, her
hands clasped quickly and tightly together, her lips
parted and her brow drew together in a frown of dismay
or pain.</p>

<p>Then I put the dog aside and went to her.</p>

<small>ON THE HILL AT SAMAC.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>As I stepped forward two persons who had been
sitting apart from her rose and came quickly toward
me. In my abstraction I had not noticed them; but
I saw now that one was a priest and the other a
matronly woman of between thirty and forty years
of age.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want? Who are you? This lady
is in my care,&#8221; said the priest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw that the dog knew me for a friend,&#8221; I
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be, but what do you want?&#8221; he asked
again.</p>

<p>I looked across to Mademoiselle. She hesitated
a moment and then spoke to the priest.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all right, father. I wish to speak to&mdash;him.&#8221;
There was just a suspicion of a pause at the last word
as though she had been in doubt how to speak of
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Father Michel&mdash;&#8221; began the priest in protest,
when she interposed and with a single gesture
silenced him.</p>

<p>The incident gave her time to regain self-possession.
Outwardly she grew calm, dignified, and
almost cold, but her eyes were burning and in them
I read the reproach I had so dreaded during my ride.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;Why have you come?&#8221; she asked, when I could
not speak; and her voice was hard to my ears and
accusing. I hung my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no answer,&#8221; I murmured. &#8220;I am sorry;
but I can go again.&#8221; I had hoped, like the fool I was,
she would have been glad to see me; and chilled and
beaten by this reception, I turned on my heel to leave.</p>

<p>Then Chris made a difficulty. He ran after me so
that at the door I had to turn to send him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call him,&#8221; I said. If she could be hard, so could
I; and my face was as cold and stern as she could
have wished her own to be.</p>

<p>But at my look she winced and bent her head.
Her interlocked fingers were strained tightly. It was
as though she understood the pain she caused me
and her own tender heart was wrung at the sight.
Chris stood looking up wistfully into my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go back, Chris. Good-bye, old dog.&#8221; He whimpered
in protest; for all the world as though he knew
we were to part. &#8220;Go, Chris, good dog,&#8221; I said
again; and then he went slowly to her and licked
the hands which were straining in such emotion.</p>

<p>She did not look at me and I turned again and
went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Burgwan!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was barely more than a whisper, but I heard
it clearly as I stepped out of the door. I did not heed
it, however. I had done wrong in coming there at
all, and I was sufficiently master of myself now to
hold to my resolve to leave her. I walked toward the
spot where I had left Karasch with the horses; but
I had not taken a dozen steps before a great scurry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
of feet came after me, and Chris was yelping with
glee and thrusting his nose into my hand and fondling
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have come, Chris. You&#8217;re only
making it all the harder, old dog. You must go
back. You belong to her now;&#8221; and turning to send
him back, I saw her coming toward us.</p>

<p>&#8220;I called to you, Burgwan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it best not to hear you, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not let you go like that,&#8221; she murmured;
and then a pause fell between us and we stood for
a minute or more, neither knowing what to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Karasch is here, too?&#8221; she said at length, seeing
him with the horses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He was anxious to know you were really
safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; There was a quick gleam of hope
in her eyes that I too had acted with the same motive.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was not my reason. I knew you were safe.
I have seen Father Michel. I came because I am a
coward. But I am going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Sharp, clear, decisive and almost peremptory
her tone was. And again we were silent in
mutual embarrassment. To relieve it somewhat I
began to move, and we walked away from the little
station along a path leading up a small grass-covered
hill and reached the top of it before we spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;When does your train leave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At eight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is an hour yet,&#8221; I said, glancing at my
watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there is just an hour,&#8221; she repeated, monotonously,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
as if glad of something commonplace to
say. And again we came to a stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you reach Belgrade?&#8221; It was a fatuous
question; but as I could not speak of what filled my
heart, I had to speak at haphazard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. We travel all night, I suppose;&#8221;
and there was an end of that subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we sit down? The view is lovely,&#8221; I said
next.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t, for God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t.&#8221; It was a cry
right from her heart. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you see what you are
making me suffer, and you talk to me of trains and
views?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must talk of something,&#8221; I replied, a little
doggedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you come here?&#8221; she asked, turning
upon me fiercely. &#8220;If you had been the man I
deemed you, you would have done as I asked&mdash;after
what I told Father Michel to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not give him time to tell me anything.
When Petrov brought me your second letter bidding
me wait for you, he told me that you had already
left for this place. I came after you at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you said you had seen the priest. Did he not
come to you? He promised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t wait for him when I learnt you had left.
I rode to him to his house. He said I should cause
you pain if I followed you and appealed to my
chivalry and said he had messages for me from you,
and urged me to stay and listen. But I had pain of
my own and with an angry laugh I rode away after
you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>&#8220;That was your view of chivalry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; that was my view of chivalry. I told you
I came because I was a coward. I am. I see it now.
And you may as well know me for what I am.&#8221; I
spoke bitterly, stung by her scornful words, and
found a curious pleasure in avowing my unworthiness.
&#8220;I have forced myself upon you, you see;
forced myself like a brute and a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t,&#8221; she interposed, putting up a hand
in protest, and turning away, walked to a fallen tree
and sat down upon it. I followed and threw myself
on the ground near and waited for her to speak. She
sat thinking awhile and then said slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Things must be made plain between us, Burgwan.
I planned to leave you in Poabja.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father Michel told me as much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was for the best, so. I knew that when once
I was in Poabja he would be able to help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And my help would be no longer needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you are angry. It helps me,&#8221; she answered,
quietly; and so silenced me. &#8220;You remember
I told you I had nothing to fear there; and I
would have told you why, but that I was afraid I
could not see him first and so warn him what not to
tell you about me. That was why I rode on into the
town, meaning to find him out by myself. He is
from Belgrade, and, of course, knows me. I meant
him to help me slip away while detaining you on
some pretext.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Others did that for him,&#8221; I put in drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were not hurt, were you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but you might have been.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>&#8220;I was not. By a happy chance Father Michel
met me while I was in the hands of the people and
had asked them to take me to him. He rescued me
at once and took me to his house. I told him then
about you and he gave orders for your release. Then
word was brought that you had threatened to take
Petrov&#8217;s life, and I wrote you that letter asking you
to remain where you were for two hours. This would
have given me time to get right away; and I was
writing you another letter, when Petrov came back
with yours. We detained him while I left, and I arranged
with Father Michel to tell you all you wished
to know about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You arranged it all very cleverly, Mademoiselle,&#8221;
I said angrily, as I rose. &#8220;I am sorry I upset your
plans. I owe you an apology. I offer it now.&#8221; I
bowed with affected ceremoniousness and added like
a brutal cad, in my anger: &#8220;I was a fool, of course,
to have looked for further consideration.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her answer was a look, no more; but as I met
her eyes my face flushed with the shame she made
me feel for my brutality. I felt I could have torn my
tongue out could the words have been unspoken. I
turned and covered my flaming cheeks with my
hands and walked away down the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Burgwan! Burgwan!&#8221; she called, and when I
did not stop came after me and laid her hand on my
shoulder. I shook it off impatiently, like a petulant
child, and she placed herself in my path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Burgwan! Is it possible that that is how it
seemed to you? My God!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>I took my hands from my face and saw that hers
was white and strained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go,&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not like that. Not with that thought,&#8221; she said,
her lips trembling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go. I am not fit to look at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with that thought of me,&#8221; she repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me go,&#8221; I cried, for the third time passionately.
&#8220;Or I will not answer for myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with that thought of me,&#8221; she repeated
again. &#8220;I cannot. Do you really think so of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, how could I? I love you with my
whole heart.&#8221; The avowal burst from me by an uncontrollable
impulse, and I stood shaken by the
vehemence of my own passion and looked for her to
shrink from me.</p>

<p>But instead she smiled softly and with maddening
sweetness as she murmured my name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Burgwan; now you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>I seized her hands to draw her to me. But this
she resisted, though she left them in mine, and as
I looked into her eyes I saw the tears there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been punished, Burgwan,&#8221; she said as she
smiled through her tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You love me, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>She met my look without faltering, smiling on
through her tears, and made a brave effort to choke
back her emotion, until her head drooped slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not ask me that, Burgwan. You must
know all the truth now. Poor Burgwan. Oh, I
think my heart is breaking.&#8221; The last was little more
than a sigh, and taking her hands from mine she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
went back up the hill to the tree and sat down again.</p>

<p>Seeing her sorrow, Chris went to her and whined
and put his head in her lap; the beast loved her well
nigh as much as I did, and her trouble grieved him
as it grieved me, I think. She threw her arms round
his neck and laid her head to his in response to his
dumb offer of sympathy.</p>

<p>In this way some minutes passed, and I knew without
words from her all the reason of her wish to
leave me. That wild thought of mine had been right.
It was from her own heart she had been flying; and
she was suffering now the pain I could have spared
her but for my insensate selfishness.</p>

<p>I knew that there were obstacles which she believed
to be insuperable between us, and I had driven her
to this admission of her love as the preface to telling
me the reasons why it was impossible.</p>

<p>But in the same moment I vowed they should not
come between us. Nothing should do that except
her own will; and if these difficulties could be overcome
by any means within my reach, my life should
be devoted to beating them down.</p>

<p>There was something or someone to fight now;
and she was a prize worth fighting for, with all the
man that was in me; and while the sight of her pain
moved and distressed me beyond words, I could no
longer feel sorry I had come after her to Samac.</p>

<p>She loved me; and the knowledge of love may have
a setting of pain and sorrow and yet be well gained
and rightly gained. Our hearts had answered one
to the other; and despite the pain, it was well that
each should know the truth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>I put away all the signs of passion and fastened
them down with the clamps of resolution. I would
win her yet, let the case be desperate as it would. I
could wait for such a victory; and while waiting, fight
to hold the love I had already won.</p>

<p>Presently, when she had become less agitated, she
called me.</p>

<p>I let her see at once that I had chosen my course.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind what you are going to tell me, it
will make no difference,&#8221; I said as I sat by her side.</p>

<p>She smiled but shook her head. &#8220;You do not
know yet,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;It is hopeless and impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not know me, or you would not use that
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember what you said about that on the hill
this morning; but this&mdash;I am so sorry, Burgwan.&#8221;
She paused and then said very steadily: &#8220;I am the
promised wife of another man.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words hit me hard, each with a sting of its
own. I had looked for anything but this; and I
needed all my resolution not to wince and shew the
pain they inflicted, but to meet her steady gaze with
one equally steady. I succeeded and forced a smile
as I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had not expected that,&#8221; I said, quietly. &#8220;But
in fact I don&#8217;t think I know what I did expect. In
any case there is a great difference between a wife
and a promised wife, Mademoiselle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be his wife within the present month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That gives us a fortnight or three weeks. The
month is only a week old.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>&#8220;You do not understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you tell me that you love another man, I
shall&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t,&#8221; she interposed with a gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not the coward who says this, and now it
is you who do not understand me. I am not making
love to you. I will never do that unless I can do it
honourably; and that cannot be while you are promised
to another man. But until you tell me that your
heart is given to another, I shall not cease to hope
and will not cease striving to win you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She listened to me and caught at my words. She
lifted her head and with an air of half-defiant pride
she made a great effort to look me straight in the
eyes and take up my challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do love&mdash;&#8221; But she could get no farther; her
head fell, and she cried, &#8220;You would shame me, Burgwan.&#8221;
I cried with intense earnestness:</p>

<p>&#8220;God forbid that I should do that, Mademoiselle.
I wish I could make it all easier for you. But this
is life to us both and nothing will serve but truth
and candour.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer this for some moments, but sat
thinking intently, her face averted from me; and
presently I said: &#8220;People have been in this plight
before, and have come out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took no notice at first and then turned with
a sad, sweet smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not make this too hard for me. I owe
you so much&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say nothing of that, please, or you will silence
me altogether, Mademoiselle,&#8221; I interposed, quickly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>&#8220;Do you forget what I told you&mdash;there would be
no Mademoiselle in Belgrade. I am the Princess
Gatrina, betrothed to Prince Albrevics, next in succession
to the Servian throne.&#8221;</p>

<p>I tried to take it with a smile as I had before taken
the news of her betrothal; but I could not. I could
not even find a word to reply. I just sat staring out
in front of me yet seeing nothing. I was like a man
stricken dumb by a sudden calamity&mdash;helpless,
numbed and beaten.</p>

<p>I must have turned deathly white, for all the blood
in my body seemed to have rushed to my heart which
beat with great lurching thumps against my ribs and
shook my whole body. Then my head where I had
been struck began to throb in response to the wild
hammer of the pulse, and I grew dizzy and faint.
My breath came with difficulty and I had to grip the
tree with strenuous hands lest I should fall from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was this I asked Father Michel to tell you,&#8221;
she said presently.</p>

<p>I heard her, of course; but her voice sounded far
away and apart from me. Much as though the barrier
between us had become substantial and she were
speaking from far on the other side of it.</p>

<p>At length I managed to get to my feet and to pace
up and down, winning the fight against my reeling
senses and gathering up the fragments of my scattered
resolution. The first sign of my victory was
a feeling of blind, bitter anger with myself for having
shewn such weakness before her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not judge me by this exhibition,&#8221; I
said, as a sort of apology. &#8220;My head pained me for
a moment. That&#8217;s all; I&#8217;m better now again.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>But her pitying eyes shewed that she understood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so sorry.&#8221; Just conventional words they
were; but the look and the tone told me how straight
from her gentle heart they came and how intensely
she was feeling. &#8220;You are ill. Sit down again.&#8221; She
did not use any name now, and I noticed the omission.
I was no longer Burgwan; and already the
restraint of our altered relations was making itself
felt. But she moved as if to make place for me on
the fallen tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not ill now, thank you; and I think it is
time for you to go.&#8221; I glanced at my watch. &#8220;Yes,
it is quite time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat on a moment, her eyes closed, and then
sighed deeply and rose. Chris got up with her and
she bent down and fondled him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Chris, dear, faithful friend, good-bye,&#8221;
she murmured, and kissed his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not take him?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now. No. I&mdash;I cannot. I should think of&mdash;of
this.&#8221; Then with a smile: &#8220;He will be so much
happier with you.&#8221; She stooped and kissed him
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is better so, perhaps.&#8221; I said. &#8220;But just as
you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was very quiet and calm now, and turning from
the dog, she held out her hand to me, with a brave
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye. You have not told me how to address
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I took the white trembling fingers, and held them
a moment with a slight pressure, which was returned.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>&#8220;It is only Burgwan who bids you good-bye,&#8221; I
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is better so. It is only Burgwan whom I can
remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused a moment, her eyes wistfully on mine,
and then impulsively held out her hand again.</p>

<p>This time I was carrying it to my lips when I remembered,
checked myself, and let it fall. She was
trembling violently, and her breathing was deep and
laboured. As I loosed her hand I heard her catch
her breath; and looking up I saw she was very white,
the lips were almost bloodless as she bit them in the
battle with her agitation.</p>

<p>We stood thus looking into one another&#8217;s eyes
for some seconds.</p>

<p>Poor little woman, she was finding it very hard;
and a fierce yearning came upon me to clasp her to
my heart and urge her to let love have its way and
trust herself to the care of my love.</p>

<p>But it was her moment of weakness, and one of
us two must be strong. I believe she knew by love&#8217;s
instinct the thought that thus rushed upon me, for
her hands were half raised and a great flush of colour
spread over her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>I stepped back and dropped my eyes to the
ground. There was a half-smothered sob, the brush
of her skirts, the light touch of her foot-fall on the
path; and when I lifted my head she had gone, hurrying
down the hillside, and Chris was looking after
her and then back at me whining in doubt.</p>

<p>I watched her go, hoping she would turn her head;
but she held on steadily and was nearing the bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
when Chris gave a short bark and scampered after
her at a mad gallop, reaching her just before a bend
in the path would have hidden her.</p>

<p>I hoped she would take him with her; but she did
not. She stopped and petted him, letting him fawn
upon her in his loving way, and stooped and kissed
him, and then I saw her point up the hill toward me.</p>

<p>He hesitated to obey her, came a few steps,
stopped and ran back to her. She petted him again,
and again ordered him back. He looked up in her
face as if in dire doubt; and then came slowly toward
me, but only to stop and turn again. She repeated
the gesture; and this time he drooped his tail and
came on.</p>

<p>She watched him; and presently looked higher up
to me. I waved my hand, but she gave no answering
signal; and before the dog reached me, she had
passed round the bend in the path and was gone.</p>

<p>I sat down on the fallen tree where we had been
together and leant my face in my hands, overcome
by a deadening sense of utter desolation and dreary
loss. This at first shut out all other thoughts.</p>

<p>But not for long. If the barrier between us was
so infinitely greater than my worst fears had conceived
that on first learning it I had been whelmed
and staggered by the blow, I had gained another
knowledge. She loved me; and with that priceless
vantage on my side I should be a coward indeed
to be daunted by any obstacles.</p>

<p>She loved me; and when I rose, my resolution was
set. I would fight on to the end to win her, let
who else and what else stand in my path.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br />


<small>PREPARING FOR THE CAMPAIGN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I don&#8217;t know any place where money talks with
such effect as in the southeast of Europe; and I made
it talk for all it was worth during the week that I
was getting ready to go to Belgrade.</p>

<p>I reckon that when you want to gain an end the
chief means are to know quite definitely what you
want, to grip on it with all your teeth, to pay liberally
for what you must know to gain it, and to hold your
tongue and let the other man do the chattering. You
may also at need have a stalking horse.</p>

<p>I used one now in the campaign to win Gatrina. I
was hit very hard when she told me the barrier
between us was no less than her chance of succeeding
to the Servian throne; but I wasn&#8217;t knocked out.
On the contrary, the bigness of the barrier soon
ceased to frighten and began to attract me. I meant
to win her; and to go to Belgrade to do it. But I
shut that purpose away in the strongest safe in my
thoughts with a time lock which would only open
to let it out when the fitting moment arrived. What
I said was that I was going to Belgrade in regard to
a big loan which that little kingdom was just then
particularly anxious to float.</p>

<p>It served me well. Any man who was going to put
his money into such a venture would naturally want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
to know things; and, if some of the points on which
I sought information did not seem to have any connection,
there were plenty of people ready to give it,
and none to bother with my motives, so long as I
chose to foot the bills.</p>

<p>I was well served by my agents, and inside the
week I knew far too much to let me dream of trusting
a nickel to the Servian exchequer, but quite
enough to enable me to go to Belgrade and play
the part of a representative of a group of American
capitalists with amiable financial intentions.</p>

<p>I knew other things, too. Secrets, many of them,
about intrigues that were in progress against the
Servian rule and government. And a nice mess of
unhealthy pottage they made. One thing I had been
particularly urgent to discover&mdash;the character of
Prince Albrevics. It was anything but cleanly. He
was one of those men who learn the commandments
pretty thoroughly by breaking every one of them
consistently, and then sigh in <i>blase</i> regret that, as
there are only ten of them, they have to stoop to repetition
in order to live comfortably.</p>

<p>My money began to talk that same evening in
Samac.</p>

<p>Soon after Gatrina had started on her journey, I
surprised the depot folk at Samac with a request for
a special train. I looked a pretty object to travel
special, no doubt; and at first they laughed and were
for hustling me out of the place as a lunatic. But I
soon had them hustling with a very different purpose.
Money did it. And inside of five minutes the station
master himself, a lean hungry looking Austrian, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
put himself absolutely at my disposal and was working
all he knew to figure out the best means of getting
me through to Vienna.</p>

<p>I said I would start in an hour and a half, and having
sent a wire in cypher to my agent in Vienna to
help matters on at that end, I went to Karasch, and
with him rode back to Poabja to get the priest&#8217;s help
in straightening things out in the matter of that Austrian
officer.</p>

<p>He did not give me a very pleasant reception.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been to Samac?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just come from there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why do you come to me?&#8221; he asked with
cold austerity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to say I&#8217;m sorry for having gone there, but
to get you to render me a service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have seen&mdash;&#8221; he paused, and I filled in the
words for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess? Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she send you to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can do nothing for you,&#8221; he answered, as if to
close matters.</p>

<p>Then I let the money talk. I counted out the sum
which I thought would be necessary for paying a
search party and also such an amount as I guessed
he would be glad to have for his church and his poor;
and laid them on the table in two heaps.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is for the church and your poor; and this
is for you to disburse for me;&#8221; and I described very
briefly what I wanted done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you thinking to bribe me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;Nothing of the kind. The Princess is involved
in this matter of the Austrian, and for her sake as
well as mine the thing must be arranged. She knows
what passed at the camp and would, of course, testify
if necessary. But I can take care of myself when I
get to Vienna; and I am going there to-night by
special train.&#8221; I added the last detail as an impressionist
money argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am an American citizen; and nothing else
matters just now. This is more for the Princess
Gatrina than for me. She had to be saved, and I
couldn&#8217;t do it with kid gloves on.&#8221; He thought over
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is either a right or a wrong thing you are asking
of me. If right I do not desire to be paid for
it; if wrong, I am not to be bribed to do it;&#8221; and he
pushed back toward me the money I had offered
him for his church.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s clean money,&#8221; I said, getting up. &#8220;You
needn&#8217;t be afraid. Keep it untouched until you are
satisfied it is clean and then use it, or not, as you
please. I should like to have a report of what you
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To whom shall I send it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To me. You heard my name&mdash;Burgwan&mdash;and
can send to that name under cover to this address in
Vienna;&#8221; and I wrote the name of a man so well
known that he started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Baron Burndoff, the great banker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the banker,&#8221; I repeated; &#8220;and my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it,&#8221; he murmured, half to himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>&#8220;There is one other little favour you might render
me. I need badly a fresh suit of clothes. Could you
tell me how to get one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not furnish disguises, sir,&#8221; he answered, so
curtly that I almost smiled, as I retorted, suavely:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to have caused you to say discourteous
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew himself up. &#8220;I am not concerned for
your feelings. I am acting for the Princess Gatrina;&#8221;
and he bowed stiffly and formally to dismiss me. But
I noticed that he kept both the sums of money; and
I went out satisfied that he would do what was necessary
and I was well pleased at the result.</p>

<p>On the ride back to Samac I made a discovery. I
was somewhat at a loss what to do with Karasch.
Staunch and brave he was undoubtedly; but there
was very much of the rough diamond about him. I
could not quite see how he was going to fit himself
into the routine of my service.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you like to do, Karasch?&#8221; I asked
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow you and serve you,&#8221; he replied simply and
promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you quite understand what that implies;
and I wish you to do so. I live thousands of
miles away, in America; and I expect to return there
soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you have done with me, you can turn me
away. I am your man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too good a fellow for me to turn you
away. But the life I live is not like that in the camp
yonder. I&#8217;ve had as much of that just now as I want.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
Life in a city is a very different thing and you might
find it cramping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish me to leave you? You have but to
speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand me. I owe you a debt
which nothing I can do for you will ever repay. But
I can do something toward it. If you can think of
any kind of life you&#8217;d like to lead, I&#8217;ll see that you
have the chance. If you&#8217;d like to be gentleman at
ease, I&#8217;ll find you the means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A gentleman at ease? What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To have enough money to live upon without
working for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He swore good humouredly, and asked with a
laugh: &#8220;Do you think I want to do nothing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;d like to work I&#8217;ll buy you a house
and some land for you to cultivate, and you can
choose where.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have chosen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To serve you,&#8221; he replied, earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must think a heap of me in that case,&#8221; I
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; he said, in just the same grave, decided
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you won&#8217;t like the city life, Karasch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t I can leave it. But I&#8217;ve lived in one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you a Serb then? Georgev said you were
Bosnian.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a Serb; and Georgev is a fool.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve lived in Belgrade, have you?&#8221; I said
as a thought occurred to me. Did he know who
Gatrina was? &#8220;How did you come to change so
toward&mdash;toward Mademoiselle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She told me something about herself when you
got that crack on the head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She made me promise not to speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had been pretty blind, it seemed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know who she is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Only that she&#8217;s a great lady in Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she tell you how she fell into the hands of
those men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; she does not know. She was carried off and
believed she was in the hands of the brigands, and
that they would hold her for a ransom. But I could
find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know Belgrade and I know the friends of the
men with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How would you get the information?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quickest to buy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Money was to talk again. &#8220;How much?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were to have three thousand gulden if they
got her to Maglai. Not getting a kreutzer, they&#8217;ll be
ready to sell the whole scheme for less than half.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you go to Belgrade?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go anywhere you send me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall go there at once and wait for me. I
shall be there in about a week. I am going first to
Vienna; and you must use the interval to get this
information for me. Lose no time and pay whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
is necessary. I&#8217;ll give you some money and send you
more. But, mind, we must have the truth&mdash;whatever
it costs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They know me too well to deceive me,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;I shall have it all in less than a week; and
have the men as well, at your service, if you want
them.&#8221; And so it was settled.</p>

<p>Money had talked when we reached Samac, and
the special was ready for us. I took Karasch with me
as far as Maria-Theresiopel, where I was to catch the
mail to Vienna, and he to get the train to Belgrade;
and on the journey I discussed the matter with him
fully and gave him such directions as were necessary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind, not a word about me until we meet in
Belgrade,&#8221; was my last parting injunction; and for
the rest of the journey I slept almost until Vienna
was reached.</p>

<p>A very full week was the week that followed; and
money was talking every minute of it, while I gathered
the information I needed and pieced it together
for the campaign I had before me.</p>

<p>It was just a big bluff I put up about that Servian
loan; and played it well enough to convince all who
came near me that I meant it right along. It was
easy to prove that I and those who were behind me
in the States had the dollars and could put them on
the table. That was true; but the bluff was to make
folks believe me soft enough to accept the security
and vouch for it to others.</p>

<p>My attitude was that of the typical Missouri man.
&#8220;Show me&#8221; was my one text. &#8220;Prove to me the
thing is sound, and I&#8217;ll find the money right now;&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
and the very strenuousness of the efforts to persuade
me was in itself enough to have made even a plunger
suspicious.</p>

<p>But I kept a very stiff upper lip; and when I raised
difficulties, hinted at concessions that should be made,
and asked for facts in regard to other matters, I was
at last referred to Belgrade direct. This was what
I wanted; and I consented to go there; but not without
making a show of reluctance.</p>

<p>In the meantime I heard from Father Michel that
he had been successful in arranging all the difficulties
in connection with the affair at the camp. The
Austrian official had exaggerated matters to me that
night in declaring there were dying men there. No
one had died; and the injured men had first been so
frightened with the threat of prosecution for their
part in the abduction that the money I had left for
them had been accepted with very grateful surprise.</p>

<p>Captain Hanske had very naturally resented his
rough handling, and, breathing many threats of what
his government would do, had forwarded a very
furious report to Vienna.</p>

<p>His superior was dining with me the day after the
report was received, and had done himself very well
indeed when he referred to the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know a priest named Father Michel in
Poabja, an out-of-the-way hole in Bosnia, don&#8217;t you,
Mr. Bergwyn?&#8221; he said with a very suggestive smile.</p>

<p>I affected to think. &#8220;Poabja? Poabja? Whereabouts
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A few miles from Samac&mdash;the point on the
frontier where the line ends; and where one might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
at a pinch get a special train; if for instance one was
in a hurry to leave the district.&#8221;</p>

<p>He intended me to know by that, of course, that my
movements had been traced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I had a friend who once went there,&#8221; I
replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;This may be about him;&#8221; and he pulled out the
report and gave it me and took another cigar and a
fresh drink, as I glanced through the paper. It was
a duly garbled official misdescription of what had occurred
that night and represented the captain as having
fought valiantly against great odds until he had
been overpowered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems to be a valiant fellow, this agent of
yours,&#8221; I said. &#8220;And this&mdash;how is he called? Burgwan,
is it?&mdash;must be a desperate character?&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed. &#8220;Singular name, isn&#8217;t it? Very
much like yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you mention it, so it is. But, of course, it
isn&#8217;t my name;&#8221; and I smiled in my turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. A strange story, though. Do
you think your&mdash;friend would know anything about
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be in the least surprised. I&#8217;ll find out.
By the way, your man seems to have been roughly
handled. Don&#8217;t you think he ought to be promoted
in some way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Promotion is slow, you see. Do you think you
could do anything for him?&#8221; he asked, as if the idea
had just occurred to him; and smiled again slyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how it affects me. Wait, I have an
idea. I can tell you how you can do it, and make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
pile for yourself at the same time. This camp on the
hills he speaks of must be the spot where my friend
went prospecting about some mine deposits. He told
me there was a fortune waiting there for the man
who developed the thing; but he knows the difficulty
which a foreigner would have in working it, and has
given it up. Why not get hold of the concessions
yourself; they can be had for a song; and put this
man in charge to carry on the work?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would take money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there would be no difficulty about that if the
thing had official influence behind it&mdash;such for instance
as yours. The thing&#8217;s right. The ore&#8217;s there,
I know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> know it?&#8221; he put in quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d trust my friend&#8217;s judgment as freely as my
own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say a fortune? How much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, anything from half a million gulden upwards.&#8221;
I spoke airily, as though a few hundred
thousand gulden were a matter of comparative insignificance.</p>

<p>He smoked for a while in silence, his brows knitted
thoughtfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;Would your friend go into it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the sort of thing I should take up myself
right now if I had your influence with me,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;You Americans are a wonderful people, Mr.
Bergwyn. We&#8217;ll speak of this to-morrow. I&#8217;ll think
it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worth doing, not only thinking over;&#8221; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
as I returned him his report I added: &#8220;And this man
really deserves some sort of compensation.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and laughed. &#8220;He
shall have an official letter praising his zeal; and we
shall hear no more of that part of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>We did talk it over the next day and we fixed up a
working arrangement. Then he spoke to me about
the Servian loan.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going into it, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They promise some valuable concessions.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and said deliberately: &#8220;If you&#8217;ll take
my advice, it is&mdash;don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too risky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve another reason. What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand Balkan
politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean your government are against the
loan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Servia might buy arms, or build railways with
the money&mdash;neither course to our interests, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bit rough on Servia, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have to think of ourselves, you see. Besides,
it isn&#8217;t safe for a little country like that to develop
too quickly. There&#8217;s Russia, too. Two big powers,
both closely concerned. Take my advice&mdash;don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to Belgrade,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means go. You&#8217;ll see things then for
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What would happen if she got the loan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t get it, Mr. Bergwyn. The government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
is tottering now&mdash;and perhaps the throne. Anything
can happen in Belgrade at any time&mdash;except the floating
of a loan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go to Belgrade. We&#8217;re ready to carry
risks, you know, when a thing&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, by all means go, as I said. They&#8217;ll make
much of you; but remember when you&#8217;re there what
I&#8217;ve said, in confidence, and&mdash;don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could judge by the insistence upon this advice
that he thought I was still undecided; and as that was
just the impression I wished to leave, I said no more.</p>

<p>Two days later I left for Belgrade, where, as my
friend the minister had told me, I found them quite
ready to make much of me, as a sort of possible
financial saviour of the country. I soon saw the influence
which I could wield even in regard to the
real purpose which took me to the capital.</p>

<p>But even within a few hours of my arrival, and
while I was disposed to shake hands with myself for
the adroit course which I was managing to steer, I
met with an ugly check&mdash;most unwelcome and disconcerting.</p>

<p>A large house had been placed at my disposal, and
I had breakfasted on the morning after my arrival
and was planning my movements for the day, when
my man, Buller, brought me a card.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Baroness von Tulken.&#8221;</p>

<p>I remembered the name. It had been given me as
that of a woman of much influence at the court who
was said to be taking an important part in political
affairs. But I could think of no reason why she
should flounce down on me almost at the moment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
my arrival. I hesitated therefore whether to see her.
But I decided I would. If time is not too pressing, it
is generally best to see people at once and get at the
kernel of their business in a couple of minutes, instead
of letting them worry you with correspondence.</p>

<p>There was the chance, too, that under the circumstances
she might have some information to give or
sell; and I was speculating who she might be and
what she wanted, as I went to her.</p>

<p>But I knew her the moment my eyes fell on her,
before I saw her face; and I started and caught my
breath in surprise and some dismay. I could have
wished her anywhere in the world except in Belgrade
at that particular juncture.</p>

<p>She was looking out of the window as I entered,
and when she turned gave me one quick glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, then it <i>is</i> you, Chase,&#8221; she cried, as she came
toward me both hands extended and uttered my
Christian name, with a smile on her handsome face,
as though the meeting were just the loveliest thing
that ever happened for us both.</p>

<small>ELMA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>A large, long room on the first floor of a house in
Prague; the furniture, once rich, now sadly worn;
the lights dim except over one table where cards
were scattered on the green cloth as they had been
left by the players; close to it, partly in shadow, a
second table with drink and glasses; near it an overturned
chair; away in the gloom a cowering figure
on a settee with old hands pressed strenuously on
the hidden face; and in the centre a queenly woman,
beautiful as a picture, white-faced, distraught and
trembling, but struggling to appear defiant as she
faced a boy of nineteen who was regarding her with
looks in which hot love, horrified repugnance and
disgust struggled with the bewildering pain of the
knowledge of her unworthiness. She had been
caught red-handed in the flagrant use of the tricks
of a common card cheat; and the rest had gone, with
flouts and scoffs and jeers, leaving the two, the boy,
face to face with the sudden consciousness of her
shame, and suffering as only a boy in his calf love
can suffer: the woman, scared and confused, but
wrathful and relying defiantly upon the power of her
beauty.</p>

<p>I was the boy; and Elma Dreschkel, now the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
Baroness von Tulken, was the woman. We had not
met since that night; but the picture flashed back
upon my memory, resistlessly and instantaneously,
as I felt once more upon me those dark, dangerous,
and strangely compelling eyes of hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are surprised, of course; but you will not
refuse me your hand,&#8221; she said, as I hesitated to take
hers.</p>

<p>I took her hand. &#8220;Yes, I am surprised,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not changed much. Older, broader,
more manly, of course, and much handsomer, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The change in my looks may not be very great.&#8221;
It was a fatuous thing to say, for it gave her a chance
which her ready wit seized at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not changed even in looks,&#8221; she said, with
a sigh and droop of the eyes and a little graceful gesture
of the hands. She did herself less than justice,
however. The seven years had ripened her beauty
of form and face; the girl had become a woman; and
the woman more than fulfilled the promise of the
girl. She was faultlessly dressed, too, with exquisite
taste; and had achieved that combination of
apparent simplicity and suggestion of costly extravagance
after which so many American women strive
not always with success.</p>

<p>She knew I was looking very closely at her and
she paused long enough to give me ample opportunity.
Then she glanced up and smiled: hers was
one of the most dangerous smiles ever given to a
woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she asked, as if challenging me. Was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
she anxious to establish our relations upon something
of the old footing?</p>

<p>&#8220;To what do I owe the favour of this visit?&#8221; I
asked in a formal and precise tone.</p>

<p>But she only laughed. &#8220;Is it a favour, really, do
you think? Do you say that only as a preface to dismissing
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, at any rate, as I said, a surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Why should it be a surprise that I wished
to see you again, and that hearing a great financier,
Chase F. Bergwyn, was coming here, I rushed here
the first moment I could to make sure that it was
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The surprise may be to find you in Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, that of course&mdash;but not that I should
wish to see you.&#8221; She had always been clever in
turning my words back upon me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid you misunderstand me,&#8221; I said after
a pause. &#8220;I meant to ask you if there was anything
I could do for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you do it, Chase?&#8221; she cried with quick
daring, flashing her eyes upon me. &#8220;I wonder if
you would. I should like to think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you regard the question as put quite formally?
This visit is quite unexpected, and as I am a
somewhat busy man just now, my time is very much
occupied.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am still standing,&#8221; she answered, unexpectedly.</p>

<p>I placed a chair for her and she sat down, gracefully&mdash;she
did all things gracefully&mdash;and smiled.
&#8220;How long can you spare me?&#8221; She put the question
lightly, with mockery in every accent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>&#8220;I have engagements right through the day.
Baroness....&#8221;</p>

<p>She interposed with a quick gesture, rose suddenly
and looked at me as if I had insulted her by this use
of her title, and her lips opened as if to give her protest
utterance; but she merely sighed and shrugged
her shoulders, and sat down again. A very effective
piece of acting&mdash;but no more than acting.</p>

<p>In reply I glanced at the card which I still held in
my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I married for money and position. What
would you have had me do?&#8221; She made the quick
question a reproach, speaking in a low, tense tone as
of carefully restrained feeling, with a dash of personal
defiance, paused and then added slowly: &#8220;I was
deserted by&mdash;everyone. Was I to starve and sink
and go on sinking and starving. The Baron was
three times my age. Wealthy, and believed in me
and trusted me. When even those who might have
had faith in me&#8221;&mdash;she paused again as she repeated
the phrase&mdash;&#8220;even those who might have had faith,
turned their backs upon me, and deserted me, he
offered me the shelter of his rank and riches and
name. And even if I had no heart to give him in
response, was I to blame for giving him my hand?
Does it lie with you to reproach me?&mdash;you, of all
men; you?&#8221;</p>

<p>So intense was her tone, so magnetic her influence,
and so realistic her acting that she actually roused in
me for the moment the feeling that in that old time
it was I who had wronged her and played the part of
coward now suggested, and not she who had cheated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
and cozened me in my boyish infatuation until for
years my faith in all women had been destroyed. Yet
I knew that she was that most dangerous of all
created beings&mdash;a beautiful woman with brains and
without a heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not reproaching you,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;On
the contrary, I congratulate you. I think you acted
very prudently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God,&#8221; she cried in an accent of intense suffering;
and first glancing at me with eyes full of sadness
and suffering, she bent her head upon her hand.
She was master of many emotions; but the acting
which had fooled the boy in love was powerless to
deceive me now.</p>

<p>A pause of some embarrassment followed. What
I wished to learn was her motive in coming to me.
She had a strong one, of course. I could gamble on
that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Need we pretend?&#8221; I asked, at length.</p>

<p>She shivered as though the words hurt her, and
then looking up suddenly, answered with a sort of
fierce <i>abandon</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. No; although God knows it is no pretence
that I am agitated at seeing you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are thus disturbed let me suggest that we
postpone the conversation until you are more self-possessed.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew in her breath sharply with a little shudder,
and stretched out a hand as if in entreaty, then
clasped it to her face and appeared to make a great
effort to regain self-restraint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bear with me a moment. This is so strange a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
meeting. I....&#8221; she stopped, and bit her lip
and smiled and sighed.</p>

<p>I watched her quite unmoved by this display.
&#8220;Yes, it is very strange,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>Next, as if having regained self-possession and
desirous of getting away from an embarrassing situation,
she said, unexpectedly, and almost crudely:
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down, Cha&mdash; Mr. Bergwyn?&#8221; She
made the correction palpable, then added: &#8220;I should
apologise for my excitement having betrayed me into
calling you by&mdash;by the name once so familiar. I am
still liable to impulses.&#8221;</p>

<p>I accepted the position thus suggested, sat down
and answered in a tone of conventional compliment:
&#8220;So beautiful a woman as you, Baroness, need never
think of apologising for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At all events I will try not to offend again,&#8221; she
said lightly. &#8220;I suppose that really I ought not to
have come to you in this way, but have waited until
we met. You are so great a man now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had some reason for coming, of course.
Shall we discuss that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I had a reason; but I find it so hard to
explain it now.&#8221; Her manner now was that of a sort
of engaging nervousness. &#8220;I declare I could almost
wish you were a stranger, Mr. Bergwyn. It would
be less difficult.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was my chance and I took it. &#8220;You may
really regard me as a stranger, Baroness;&#8221; I said,
gravely, with emphasis; but she smiled winningly, intentionally
disregarding my meaning, and replied
with great sweetness:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>&#8220;You were always considerate.&#8221; She paused and
continued then with a glance:</p>

<p>&#8220;I had my reasons for coming to you, of
course. I suppose I may be frank. In the first
place I wished to be sure that you were the Mr.
Bergwyn who knew me before I came to Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes said more than her words then and I
gave the assurance they sought.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I understand you, pray be quite at rest. Since
we parted you have lived your life and I have lived
mine&mdash;and our memories do not go behind that new
life.&#8221; I meant that if she did not wish me to give
her away, I did not want that old boyish intrigue of
mine raked up. She was relieved by the assurance,
and could not hide the feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sure of that, of course,&#8221; she answered with
a scarcely perceptible sigh of relief. &#8220;It does not
affect your purpose here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course your agents have been making inquiries
about everything here, and I suppose you
know something of my position and influence. I am
a rich woman, Mr. Bergwyn, and stand high in the
confidence of many people in Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had heard of the Baroness von Tulken as one
enjoying considerable influence at Court.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have influence; and even if I had found
you a stranger I intended to place it entirely at your
service. Need I say how much more I should wish
to do so, seeing you are who you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought we were not to remember that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>&#8220;How precise you men of business are!&#8221; she
laughed. &#8220;Well, do you accept my offer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be charmed, of course, and if the need
arises I shall instantly remember your promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a refusal?&#8221; she asked swiftly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A conditional acceptance rather, is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not come for conditions. I came for frank
acceptance or rejection of my offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I arrived but last night,&#8221; I reminded her, blandly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are playing with words. What is your object
in Belgrade?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think everyone in the capital who knows of
my presence knows why I have come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I mean your secret object. You have not
come here to lend this money. Englishmen&mdash;I beg
pardon, even Americans do not act like madmen in
such matters. You know there is no stability in the
kingdom, no security that even your interest would
be paid. Why then do you come? What part are
you proposing to play in all the intrigues at present
rife here? Whose side do you take and why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The negotiations for the loan....&#8221; I began
when she cut me short with a laugh and waved
the words aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you want to buy with your money?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will put it another way,&#8221; She interposed again.
&#8220;Which party are you with? The army are intriguing
against the present dynasty; are you with
them? The Crown is intriguing to secure the next
succession for the Queen&#8217;s brother; are you with
them? Another party is intriguing to secure the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
Princess Gatrina in her rights; are you with them?&mdash;with
us, I should say. If you are, then indeed
your millions may be safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear I do not understand you. The Queen is
responsible for the betrothal of the Princess to the
Prince Albrevics; how then....&#8221;</p>

<p>The interposing laugh was now scornful.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have indeed much to learn. You will hold
what I may say in confidence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but without pledging myself to make no
use privately of any information; and I think you
should not speak,&#8221; I answered after a pause of doubt
whether I could rightly let her speak freely. But
she had no hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take your word and any risks. I wish you,
if you take any side, to take ours. The Queen&#8217;s object
in promoting the marriage of the Princess&mdash;as
good a girl as ever lived&mdash;with such a vile reprobate
as this Albrevics is&mdash;what do you think? Nay, you
would not see it, not understanding the cross currents
of our matters here. She knows, as all the
country knows&mdash;except Gatrina herself, perhaps&mdash;that
of all the impossible successors to the throne he
is the most impossible. She does it that Gatrina&#8217;s
claims may thus be destroyed finally and Gatrina herself
in this clever way removed from the path of the
Queen&#8217;s brother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very smart, very subtle, and very feminine,&#8221; I
said, with a smile as though the plan appealed to my
appreciation of a really clever move. &#8220;And what is
your plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First, what is your motive in Belgrade? Would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
you help in so shameful a scheme against the Princess?&#8221;</p>

<p>I affected to consider and then answered with more
truth than she knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I think I can safely say I should not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sure of it,&#8221; she cried, triumphantly. &#8220;And
you would not help the army in their plans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They can be put in one word&mdash;assassination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God forbid that I should deal with such a thing.
But you must be mad to think it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and then said slowly with significant
emphasis:</p>

<p>&#8220;When I know not, and how I know not, but
matters will come to that if the army once have the
courage to act. The Queen has some strong friends,
but some terrible enemies; and there is but one way
to avert catastrophe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By securing the succession to the Princess
Gatrina by the only means which can render it
secure.&#8221; She fixed her eyes upon me with an intent,
searching look.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is your scheme, you mean. How would
you do it?&#8221; I had no scruple in questioning her
now. I saw that some plan against Gatrina was in
the making, and was ready to go to lengths now to
know it.</p>

<p>&#8220;By securing her marriage with a man who would
be accepted by the country as a king.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And there is such a man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; the Duke Barinski, of Fagodina.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>&#8220;I have never heard of him. What claim to the
throne can he make?&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled significantly. &#8220;He has many. He is
connected by descent with the Karageorgevics, while
the Princess represents the Obrenovics. Together
their claim would be incontestable, as it would reconcile
and unite the rival interests. And what is
most&mdash;he has the support of Russia. Now you
understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>your</i> motive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke is the head of the family of which I
am a humble member.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very beautiful member certainly, and a very
useful one, also certainly; but I should not use the
term humble, Baroness. You seem to have a strong
cause, particularly with Russian influence behind.
You think it will succeed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It cannot fail,&#8221; she said in a tone of dead conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Princess Gatrina? What are her
views?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;In a marriage of
State what does it matter to the bride who the groom
may be? She at present trusts the Queen, and so
accepts even such a man as Albrevics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all very interesting, but there is one question
which a business man would put&mdash;a man looking
of course to his own interests only. If those who are
with me in this joined in this scheme, would the Russian
influence go so far as to guarantee the loan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I can pledge the Russian Government?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>&#8220;Scarcely that, perhaps, but in such a case you
may have some influence.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed very musically. &#8220;You are much
quicker than you used to be. Chase&mdash;I beg your pardon,
Mr. Bergwyn&mdash;you think I am a Russian agent.
Well, you are right. I am. My husband, the Baron,
was one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is dead. Of course you know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon; I did not. And you told your
people, of course, that you were coming to see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she understood me; and again she laughed.
&#8220;Yes. I told them it was possible I might have
some influence with you&mdash;some personal influence,
of course.&#8221; She paused and added, slowly: &#8220;But I
see now that I was wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate I think we may now say we understand
each other and this matter,&#8221; I said as I rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will join us? There is no other way to make
your interests safe. Russian influence is paramount.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me if I hold my decision over. What
you have said has greatly impressed me.&#8221; It had,
but not quite in the way she may have thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall see something of you while you are
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long I remain is, of course, uncertain,&#8221; I
answered; and the evasion displeased her.</p>

<p>&#8220;That may mean no. But I must see you. I
insist, I do, indeed, positively insist;&#8221; and she laid
her hand on my arm and smiled winningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I may go over to the Austrian side, whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
that may be. They may also have eloquent advocates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may find the Queen&#8217;s chief advocate the
most difficult to resist. I think I ought to warn
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess Gatrina&mdash;a very beautiful girl and
very persuasive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortunately the start I gave passed unnoticed as
her eyes were off me at the moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to be a contest of beautiful women,
Baroness,&#8221; I said with a bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is perhaps fortunate for you, therefore, that
you are now only a business man&mdash;with a short
memory,&#8221; she retorted with a glance which I affected
not to see.</p>

<p>Then an unexpected incident followed. I accompanied
her to the door and as we crossed the hall,
Chris was lying there. He got up and she looked
at him and paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is an enormous dog, Mr. Bergwyn. I do
not like big dogs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chris will not hurt you. He is gentle as he is
big&mdash;unless on necessary occasions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You call him Chris?&#8221; she exclaimed, in a tone
of surprise. &#8220;That is something of a coincidence;
I hope it is not an omen,&#8221; and she gave me a keen
glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why a coincidence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking of the Queen&#8217;s advocate&mdash;Gatrina.
She has had some adventure in which a dog named
Chris took a part. I hope it is not an omen that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
will side with her. I am very superstitious, you
know. We Serbs are.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she was not a Serb and was far too sensible to
be superstitious. Besides, there was an expression
on her face as she drove away that I would have
given a good deal to have understood.</p>

<small>DEVELOPMENTS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I should have reckoned it bad luck to run up
against Elma once more under any circumstances;
but it was much worse to find her installed here in
Belgrade, a woman of rank, wealth and influence,
in close touch with the court and with Gatrina, and
taking a part in the game of political intrigue likely
to render her a serious opponent to my purpose.</p>

<p>There was no use blinking at ugly facts, or attempting
to hide from myself that if she came to
learn the real purpose of my presence in Belgrade,
she could do me incalculable mischief; and I did not
begin to persuade myself that if the occasion arose
she would hesitate to do it.</p>

<p>It was in this wise. In those silly, calf days of my
boyish infatuation I had written the usual wild, high-falutin
nonsense to her&mdash;and plenty of it. Pouring
out my soul to her, I had thought it then: making
an egregious young ass of myself, I deemed it now;
but soulful or asinine, there were the letters on record
against me. Nor could I doubt that if Elma found
me attempting to use my influence with Gatrina
against the plans of the Russian party those letters
would be used for all they were worth to checkmate
that influence.</p>

<p>Elma had indeed been clever enough to appeal to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
me to bury the past and to hint that she was afraid
of my revealing what I knew about her. But she
had meant it more as a bluffing appeal to my sense
of honour. She knew she had little enough to fear
from any revelations. They might damage her
Court influence; but the Russian authorities who employed
her would not care a red cent. They would
have no inconvenient scruples so long as she was
useful to them. Very probably they knew all about
her already, and had perhaps used the knowledge to
give a twist to the screw which kept her zealous in
their service.</p>

<p>I flinched and flushed at the thought of those letters
being read by Gatrina. That must be stopped
somehow, and I must get them back into my possession.
But how? I could not see any means at
present. Elma was just an abominably clever
woman. She had shewn that by rising to her present
position out of the ashes of that old scandal in
Prague; and I was only too painfully conscious that
in any play of wits in such a matter she would almost
certainly outwit me.</p>

<p>Yet disconcerting as was this personal side of the
matter, it was not by any means the most disturbing
result of that talk with her.</p>

<p>She had made me realise that the obstacles in my
way were vastly greater than I had reckoned. The
whole axis of the position seemed to have shifted, indeed.
I had come to Belgrade with the somewhat
vague notion that by means of my wealth and the
knowledge I had gained of the character of Prince
Albrevics, I should be able to stop the proposed marriage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
But that somewhat arrogant assurance was
beaten out of me at a stroke. Money was useless
here.</p>

<p>I saw that Gatrina&#8217;s marriage was the centre round
which two at least of these ugly schemes of high
political intrigue actually revolved. It was one of
the most critical issues of that most critical time;
and in regard to it her happiness and welfare were
just the last things to which anyone concerned gave
five cent&#8217;s worth of consideration.</p>

<p>The Court scheme meant her sacrifice to such a
man as this Albrevics in order that she might be out
of the way of the Queen&#8217;s project to secure the succession
for her brother. The Russian plan was
scarcely less treacherous. They were wishing to use
her as a counter in order to get their own puppet on
the Throne. No more and no less.</p>

<p>Then there was the third plot&mdash;that of the army;
and so far as it concerned Gatrina it threatened to be
worse than either of the others. If it came to a head
and Elma&#8217;s grim forecast of assassination were realised,
it would be directed against the Obrenovics
family as a whole. Gatrina, as a member of that
family, would be in actual personal danger; for it was
difficult to think that one so directly in the line of
succession as she was would be allowed to slip
through the meshes of a net flung wide and drawn in
by strong, angry, merciless hands.</p>

<p>I had looked for anything rather than this. But
Elma had outlined the picture; and my own concern
for Gatrina soon painted in the details in lurid and
alarmist colours.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>I was still groping for the guiding thread in all
this tangled skein of trouble when the first of my
appointed visitors was announced, and I had to assume
my role of hard-headed business man in regard
to the proposed loan.</p>

<p>He was a man high up in the Government, and I
listened gravely to his proposals, putting a number of
objections much as I had done in Vienna; and then
said that I had heard so much of the instability of
the Government and of plots and conspiracies, that I
must take time to satisfy myself what they all meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need have no apprehension, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221;
he declared blandly. &#8220;The Throne and the Government
have never been more secure; and now that the
vexed question of the succession is about to be so
happily settled, there is not the slightest ground for
alarm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be settled how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the marriage of the Princess Gatrina to
Prince Albrevics. All faction will end with that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Russia?&#8221;</p>

<p>He waved his hands deprecatingly. &#8220;Russia will
accept the situation. She always does, when once
it is established.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the Queen&#8217;s popularity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was never greater. Her strength is paramount.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And her intentions as to her brother&#8217;s succession?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The merest <i>canard</i>&mdash;absolutely without foundation.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;You think Prince Albrevics would be accepted
by the country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Personally I regret he is not a&mdash;not more discreet.
But he will reform when his responsibilities
grow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many hold that view?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not popular, it is true; but we Serbs are a
peace-loving people and, when a thing is settled and
makes for peace, we accept it and work for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the army?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been discontent, I know, and certain
appointments have been made by the Crown which
have provoked criticism. But the leaders are loyal
and sound. There will be no trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would wish to convince myself at first hand.
Whom should I see? I want the name of a man who
knows; and not necessarily a Government man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can take it from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That does not mean you would rather I saw no
one?&#8221;</p>

<p>He flinched at the blunt question very slightly and
then smiled. &#8220;Certainly not. I am not so foolish.
You have come to convince yourself and we wish to
help you do this. There is, of course, some disaffection
in certain regiments; but on no considerable
scale. No man knows the feeling of the army
as a whole better than Colonel Petrosch. And you
can speak to him freely. He is the better man for
you to see, perhaps, because he is not by any means
a friend of the Court.&#8221;</p>

<p>I remembered the name as one which had been
given me by my Austrian friends in Vienna; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
having thus obtained what I wanted, I got rid of my
visitor as soon as possible.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone I looked up the note I
had made about this Colonel Petrosch and was surprised
to find him described as a man with a strong
grievance against the Government, having considerable
influence in the army, and believed to be using
that influence against the Throne.</p>

<p>This looked as though he were the very man I
sought, and I resolved to go to him at once. But
I was to have a stroke of good fortune in that matter.
I was ready to start when my servant, Buller, came
in.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a rough-looking fellow asking for you,
sir, and says you sent for him. But I thought I&#8217;d
better tell you first. I told him you were busy and
that he had better write.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t catch his name, sir. I can&#8217;t understand
the language; but it sounded something like
Crash.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;Karasch, Buller. Bring him up at
once; and be very civil to him. He wishes to be
your fellow-servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Buller&#8217;s features were at that moment a study.
Well-trained servant though he was, and correct and
phlegmatic as an Englishman could be, it was now
beyond his power to conceal the dismay and disgust
he felt at the prospect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he stammered at length and turned to
go.</p>

<p>&#8220;He saved my life, Buller, at the risk of his own;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
and I think a heap of him, even if he does lack a
little polish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he said now in his most correct manner,
and went out to return in a moment. &#8220;This
way, Mr. Crash,&#8221; I heard him say as he opened the
door, and not a trace of feeling was on his stolid
face as he ushered him in.</p>

<p>Karasch was vastly impressed at finding me in such
surroundings and his fine dark eyes rolled about him
with a gaze of wonderment and settled first upon
Chris, who got up at his entrance, and then upon
me. I think he was not a little nervous for all his
attempt to appear self-possessed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done my lord&#8217;s bidding,&#8221; he said at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is your arm better, Karasch?&#8221;</p>

<p>He started as though the question recalled the old
tussle between us. &#8220;It is getting well, my lord.&#8221;
He felt apparently that I ought to be addressed by
some title.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good; then sit down and tell me what you&#8217;ve
done; and by the way, don&#8217;t call me my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>A glance round the room and a waive of the hand
shewed me his thought. &#8220;As you please, Excellency;
I am only your servant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, we&#8217;ll leave it at that. Now tell me
your news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen the friends of the men who took
away the lady, and I know who they were serving. I
have also seen her and know who she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who hired them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke Barinski of Jagodina, Excellency.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
She is the Princess Gatrina&mdash;but the men did not
know her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Duke Barinski! Are you sure?&#8221; I exclaimed.
This was news indeed. &#8220;Are you sure, Karasch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen the man with whom he made the
bargain. He is at your service now, Excellency; I
have paid him. If you wish to see him, I will bring
him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All I need is to be quite certain. He would not
deceive you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows better, Excellency,&#8221; answered Karasch,
with a dry, significant smile. &#8220;I hold his life
here;&#8221; and he held out his hand with fingers and
thumb pressed together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is but little to tell, Excellency.&#8221; He appeared
to derive some sort of satisfaction from using
this title frequently. &#8220;I knew where to go for the
information, as I told you; and as soon as I had done
as your Excellency bade me and seen a doctor about
my arm, I sought the men out; they are old companions
of mine and, as I had money they welcomed
me. For three days we drank together and I had
the story from three or four of them, both when they
were drunk and when sober; and it was always the
same. The Princess was at the great house of the
Baroness von Tulken one evening, and when she
wished to leave, she was put into a carriage not her
own with two of the men dressed in her livery. They
drove her by a certain route and at an agreed spot
the six men who were to take her to Maglai stopped
the carriage and with a show of force seemed to compel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
the coachman to drive away into the country,
two of the men entering the carriage to keep the
Princess quiet. They told her they were brigands;
and after some miles they compelled her to alight and
ride with them. They were to take her to Maglai
and to receive one thousand gulden, not three as
they told your Excellency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the witchcraft business, Karasch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke Barinski told them she was a witch,
Excellency, who had been detected and was being
sent off privately in this way, because she had too
many friends of influence to be tried openly in Belgrade.
Had they known who she was really, they
would have been afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he risked her very life. They might have
killed her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Excellency; because not a kreutzer was to
be paid to them at Maglai if the slightest harm was
done to her. It was clever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was devilish,&#8221; I said, hotly. &#8220;Where in Maglai
were they to take her and who was to pay the
money?&#8221;</p>

<p>He produced a slip of paper with a name and address
upon it. &#8220;You can make inquiries if you wish,
Excellency,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You will find what I have
said is the truth. It is the Duke Barinski&#8217;s plotting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean he went so far as to see these
men himself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not declare himself, Excellency; but he
was recognised.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat thinking a moment over the news.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>&#8220;Have you any guess as to his motive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I could have none; nor could my friends,&#8221;
he answered, shaking his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would your men bear this story out even to his
face?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? They are now in your service&mdash;that
is, if you wish me still to pay them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Money was not to be so entirely useless after all,
it seemed. &#8220;Yes, pay them, Karasch. Have you
any money left?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brought it;&#8221; and he produced the greater
part of what I had given him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better keep it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be safer with you. You can give it me
as I need it, Excellency;&#8221; and he laid it on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take what you want;&#8221; and he took a very moderate
sum which he declared would be enough. I
told him then that for the present he had better not
live in my house but was to come night and morning
for instructions, and to let me know how to communicate
with him instantly in the event of my needing
him in any pressing emergency.</p>

<p>His news gave me plenty of matter to chew, and
I sat turning it over and over in my mind. I saw
Elma&#8217;s pro-Russian hand in it plainly; and although
Karasch and his companions could make no guess
at the motive for the abduction, I could make one.</p>

<p>Had they succeeded in the scheme of getting
Gatrina to Maglai they would have kept her there
until she had consented to marry Duke Barinski.
Then their plan to secure the succession would have
come into the field of practical politics; the Queen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
would have been quietly checkmated; Russian influence
would have openly backed up the united claim
of the Duke and Gatrina; and the crooked path
would suddenly have been made smooth.</p>

<p>Gatrina&#8217;s escape from her guards had alone prevented
this and her safe return to Belgrade had no
doubt completely disconcerted the schemers.</p>

<p>But they were not of the kind to put aside the plan
because of this check and we might look for some
other move from them equally daring, cunning and
far-reaching.</p>

<p>They had acted cleverly indeed, and had blinded
their tracks successfully. The Duke had kept carefully
in the background and Elma had so far retained
the confidence of Gatrina as actually to learn from
her some details of her escape.</p>

<p>I did not forget her reference to the &#8220;adventure
in which a dog called Chris&#8221; had played a part; and
I might gamble on it that, if they discovered the part
I had taken, I should soon find myself the object of
some of their attentions. And they were antagonists
whom anyone would be prudent to take very
seriously.</p>

<p>Complications were developing at a merry rate;
but Karasch&#8217;s news had suggested a way by which
one of Gatrina&#8217;s suitors at any rate might be driven
from the field.</p>

<p>This was to face the Duke himself, tell him what
I knew, confront him with the men he had employed,
and see what the effect on him would be of a threat
to reveal the whole plot to the Court. The Queen&#8217;s
readiness in dealing drastically with her enemies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
would frighten him surely enough; and I knew the
Russian tactics too well not to feel assured that, if
once he were discovered and disgraced, they would
drop him instantly in favour of some shrewder tool.</p>

<p>Then came another development. A chamberlain
from the Court brought me an invitation to a reception
for the following night at the Palace; and was
at some pains to make it clear that it was to be held
out of compliment to myself and &#8220;those other illustrious
Magnates of America&#8221; who were associated
with me.</p>

<p>Money was talking loudly enough in that, at any
rate; and I sent him away with an assurance of my
appreciation of the honour, expressed in such flowery
terms as occurred to me at the moment. Even as I
was speaking to him my thoughts slipped back to
what Elma had said about the &#8220;Queen&#8217;s advocate.&#8221;</p>

<p>I should meet Gatrina again. In a moment a
hundred qualms of doubt were started as to how she
would receive me, rendering me uneasy, restless, and
almost nervous.</p>

<p>What would she say? How would she look?
Would the brute she was going to marry be present?
Would she reproach me for thus again forcing myself
on her? Would she see through the flimsy
hypocrisy of my pretended financial mission? Would
she give me away to the Court? Should I get a
chance of telling her of the danger in which she
stood? And then, somehow, that scene on the hill
at Samac a week before, came into my thoughts and
I sat smoking, mooning and dreaming.</p>

<p>Gatrina seemed so desperately far removed from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
me now and the opposing forces were gathering such
strength that my confidence of success gave ominous
signs of wavering. The prospect of winning her
looked like no more than a forlorn hope; and although
I was as determined as ever to fight on until
I was actually beaten, I felt a cold chill of doubt
settling down upon me.</p>

<p>Buller entered, breaking my reverie just at that
moment, to bring me a card. I took it impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Nikolitch, from Colonel Petrosch.&#8221;</p>

<p>I uttered an involuntary exclamation of delight.
My visitor was a man who had been my close and
intimate friend in that past time in the Balkans; and
coming as he did from Colonel Petrosch, he was just
the man of all others able to help me. No one could
have been more welcome at such a juncture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show him right here, Buller,&#8221; I said, gleefully,
standing up to welcome him cordially.</p>

<p>The pendulum had swung right over suddenly and
the luck was once again on my side.</p>

<small>THE ARMY&#8217;S PLANS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Nikolitch was as glad to meet me as I to welcome
him, and our mutual greeting was very warm and
cordial.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could scarcely believe it was really you, Bergwyn,&#8221;
he said, when we were through with the hand-shaking
and had lighted our cigars. &#8220;That was
why I wrote on my card that I came from Colonel
Petrosch. I can scarcely believe it now, I think;&#8221;
and he smiled. He was a year or so older than I; a
fair, handsome, frank-faced fellow with a winning
manner and a delightful smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bit like a fairy tale, perhaps. How did you
hear of me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a question, my dear fellow, when you&#8217;re
the centre of financial attraction just now in half a
dozen circles. And do you mean to tell me you&#8217;re a
millionaire? Why, in those jolly old days you were
as poor as I was and, worse luck, still am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were jolly old days, weren&#8217;t they? I am
just delighted to see you again. Yes, I&#8217;m a millionaire;
and if you&#8217;d done as I wanted you to then, gone
out with me to the States, you would be one too. I
had a toughish time of it for a year or two; and it
was all luck at the end. Nothing else. I got hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
of a mine which had broken the hearts of the men
who had been working it with me. When they gave
up in despair I got it for next to nothing and held
on; and inside a month came on the gold by pure
accident just where we hadn&#8217;t looked for it. My
perseverance had paid me and I stepped out of the
mine that day as rich as a man need wish to be.
That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were always a dogged beggar,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like being beaten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same thing another way round,&#8221; he laughed.
&#8220;And so you&#8217;ve come back to the old hunting
ground to take a hand here as a big financier. You&#8217;ll
have to be careful, Bergwyn. This is no gold mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s nothing to tell; nothing much. I
entered the army here, and having some influence,
got my captaincy sooner than I deserved it. I like
it well enough; but I wish I&#8217;d gone with you. I&#8217;d
rather be a millionaire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does Colonel Petrosch send you to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a favourite of his a bit, and of others.
They&#8217;ve let me know things, you see; trust me, I
suppose; and all that. When I heard your name
mentioned I pricked up my ears, and told Petrosch
I fancied I knew you. He wants you and your
money bags on the side of the army in all this mess
of messes; and picked me out as a sort of informal
ambassador to negotiate with you. Though why the
devil you want to meddle with things here beats me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had the Colonel&#8217;s name given me this morning
as a man who could tell me the hang of things in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
regard to the intentions of the army. I suppose he
could.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nikolitch laughed. &#8220;If he can&#8217;t no one can, Bergwyn.
But who sent you to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>I told him the name of the Minister.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the blue sky, that&#8217;s a curiosity. Why, old
Petrosch is in the very thick of the army plans and
dead against the Court, King, Queen, and all the
rest of them. He&#8217;ll grin when I tell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Minister assured me that the army was loyal
to the throne, and that the Colonel could convince
me of that. He admitted there was some disaffection
in certain regiments, but that the feeling was
insignificant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s an ass; and nothing else. That&#8217;s the
usual rot talked in the Court circles; and of course
the officers don&#8217;t undeceive them and shew their
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what&#8217;s the truth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why that&mdash;of course we&#8217;re talking as old friends,
Bergwyn, and you won&#8217;t repeat what I say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you my word on that. I&#8217;m going to talk
to you presently about myself on the same understanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the fact is then that we&#8217;re on the eve of a
revolution; and there&#8217;s only one real power in the
country. The army. They can&#8217;t stand the Queen&#8217;s
methods&mdash;and they don&#8217;t mean to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t understand either the King or the Queen.
She&#8217;s one of the most wonderful women that ever
drew breath; and in some respects the ablest and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
shrewdest. In others, she acts like a perfect fool.
She comes from the people, of course; and that&#8217;s
against her; but she could have made her position
absolutely secure if she&#8217;d shewn a gulden&#8217;s worth of
tact in the right direction. But she never does.
She could have had the army leaders at her feet; but
she has alienated every one of them, by sticking all
sorts of impossible men, relations or favourites, at
the top of things; and degrading every man of
capacity who won&#8217;t kow-tow to her in everything.
As a result, bar her favourites she hasn&#8217;t a friend left
in the army. It&#8217;s the same in everything else; and
the limit has been reached.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the King?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He says ditto to every word she utters. She
can&#8217;t forget she came from the gutter, or near it;
and, having power, is never at rest unless she is shewing
it. She wants us all to be too afraid of her to
dare to remember her origin. That, at least, is what
many of us think. Anyhow, she has made the present
position impossible and the officers are going
to change it. It&#8217;s the only way to save the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How will they change it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;By a revolution,
Bergwyn; a peaceful one, if possible; but a revolution,
certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If possible? What does that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The abdication of the King and Queen&mdash;if they&#8217;ll
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if they won&#8217;t go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll have to,&#8221; he replied, with another shrug.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
&#8220;To tell you the truth, there&#8217;s a section of the
officers who urge violent means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Assassination?&#8221; I recalled Elma&#8217;s prophecy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it comes to that,&#8221; he said, gloomily. &#8220;I&#8217;m
dead against violent methods; but what they contend
is that it is better half a score of lives should
be lost than as many thousands by a civil war. Our
hope&mdash;I mean the hope of the moderate men in the
army&mdash;is that the King will see the uselessness of
resisting the army and go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are convinced that the army will stand together?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Petrosch gave me the proofs to bring
to you;&#8221; and he took out some papers and plunged
into a description of the feeling in almost all the regiments
in the army.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks convincing enough on paper,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Bergwyn, it&#8217;s the result of months of
work and agitation, and you may rely on it. And
we have the country with us. Look here;&#8221; and out
came more papers, proving that the feeling of people
of all classes was on the side of the army.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is only one real power in Servia to-day,
Bergwyn. The army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why does Colonel Petrosch send you to me
with all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two reasons. Either that you may be induced
to join our side at once; or, failing that, that you may
be persuaded of the uselessness of financing the Government
or any other faction opposed to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your own opinion, Nikolitch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, I&#8217;m only a fly on the wheel; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
I think you must be in a great hurry to chuck your
money away, if you think of taking any side at all.
The army will win in the end: we must, for nothing
can stop us; and there will be a new Government,
and with a new King&mdash;Peter Karageorgevics, I expect&mdash;but
until things are settled what&#8217;s to be your
security for any loan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You put it plainly,&#8221; said I, with a smile at his
bluntness.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I came for, Bergwyn. I speak
partly as old Petrosch&#8217;s mouthpiece, but chiefly as an
old chum. Mind you, when the new Government is
in the stirrups matters may be different; there&#8217;s a
great deal got to happen before that, however. But
I suppose you don&#8217;t really come to fool your money
away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that a mouthpiece question or your own?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Petrosch might like to know,&#8221; he laughed, stroking
his moustache; &#8220;but of course I shan&#8217;t tell him a
word you don&#8217;t wish me to repeat. He doesn&#8217;t think
you came here with any thought of such business;
but he does want to kill the chance of your doing any
with others than the army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the army really holds the key to the position
I might wish to have their influence for a certain
purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a cute devil, and that&#8217;s the truth. That&#8217;s
just how he summed up your visit. But of course
he doesn&#8217;t know what the purpose is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could the influence be got?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Bergwyn, anything could be got in this
little kingdom of ours&mdash;at a price. I fancy his notion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
is that you are after a title of some sort, or some
concessions, and are ready to buy them by floating
this loan. That&#8217;s the idea in the Court too, I know.
I chuckled when I heard it&mdash;but then I know you
and they don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I don&#8217;t want either a title or concessions;
but I can see now the gist of certain hints thrown
out this morning. What I do want is to get to the
bottom of certain things here in the first place.
You&#8217;ve spoken freely enough about the army, are
you at liberty to talk about other matters?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am. Fire away, ask what you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are the Court intentions about the succession?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Queen means to secure it for her brother&mdash;and
it&#8217;s that which has put the final touch to the army
discontent. They simply won&#8217;t have him; and yet
it&#8217;s a fact that the formal pronouncement in his
favour is actually drawn up. Some of our people
have seen the document. Of course it&#8217;s a secret;
but we&#8217;ve got friends even in the Palace itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the claims of the Prince Albrevics and his
marriage with Princess Gatrina?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course, mere rot. The Princess stands
in the direct line of succession, but she&#8217;s a woman
and barred from the throne. Albrevics is an impossible;
everyone knows that&mdash;and a very unsavoury
impossibility too. But the Princess has or had something
of a following and they would be glad to see
her on the throne if a husband could be found who&#8217;d
be received as King. They know this at Court, and
so the plan is hatched to marry her to Albrevics and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
get her out of the road. It&#8217;s an infernal business, for
she&#8217;s just as good as gold. But she&#8217;s in the way of
the Court schemes and consequently is to be sacrificed.
That&#8217;s a specimen of the royal methods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there another scheme about here&mdash;to
marry her to the Duke Barinski?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve heard that, eh? That&#8217;s the Russian
plan. He&#8217;s a tool of Russia and would make a pretty
puppet for them if they could succeed. But they
won&#8217;t. The army won&#8217;t have it; and what the army
decides will be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You astound me,&#8221; I exclaimed in surprise at the
freedom with which he spoke. &#8220;Does everybody
know everybody else&#8217;s schemes in this extraordinary
country?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty well. I suppose it looks odd to a stranger;
but our chief talk here is conspiracy of one kind or
another. Why, even the plans of the army have been
carried to the Court; and they are so blind that they
won&#8217;t believe them. It isn&#8217;t etiquette there even to
think that anything hostile to the Court can happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any other plots?&#8221; I asked with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heaps; but you&#8217;ve got hold of the three that
count for anything; and only that of the army will
come to a head. Next, please;&#8221; and he threw himself
back in his chair and laughed at my look of surprise.
After a moment he added: &#8220;There&#8217;s only one
person in all the mess I pity&mdash;the Princess Gatrina.
She may find things very ugly; although there&#8217;s not
a soul who knows about her who would do her an
injury. You&#8217;ve heard the tattle about her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>&#8220;She was kidnapped the other night; at least, so
we believe. At any rate she disappeared and no one
knew where she&#8217;d gone. There was a story that she
had been carried off by brigands; but that&#8217;s all rot, of
course. Nobody knows exactly what happened except
herself, perhaps; although I doubt if she does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; I said, quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; His astonishment was complete.
&#8220;The devil you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you. Nikolitch: as my friend,
you know, not the Colonel&#8217;s mouthpiece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m friend first, Bergwyn, mouthpiece only afterwards&mdash;and
a long way afterwards, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;m here because of the Princess;&#8221;
and I told him as briefly as I could of the adventure
in the hills and Karasch&#8217;s discovery of the part played
by Duke Barinski. I said nothing, however, of my
feelings for Gatrina, leaving him to believe merely
that I was anxious for her safety.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a lucky devil, Bergwyn,&#8221; was his first
comment. &#8220;I wish I could have had such a chance
to serve her. But what an infernal scheme! What
are you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want the army influence to protect her in case
of trouble. Now you understand. How can I get
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell Petrosch what you&#8217;ve told me in the first
place, and in the second, pledge yourself to negotiate
a loan for the new Government as soon as it&#8217;s well
established.&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought a moment. &#8220;No, to the first part,&#8221; I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
said. &#8220;That&#8217;s for ourselves alone at present. To
the second, yes, as soon as you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very quick. He&#8217;ll guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess what?&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled significantly. &#8220;You want this Albrevics
marriage off, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any woman should be prevented from marrying
such a brute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he replied, drily, and paused. &#8220;You
might put it on that ground; but he wouldn&#8217;t believe
it was all. We don&#8217;t deal much in platonic affection
in Servia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what he believes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know him if he wouldn&#8217;t be glad to believe
a lot. The princess is very much in the way. I
told you no one wishes her any harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that grave look?&#8221; I asked,
for his face was very serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very ugly matter. I told you what the
moderate men among us feel; but there&#8217;s the other
section to be reckoned with. If their views prevail,
it will be a clean sweep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A clean sweep?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; everyone connected with the Obrenovics
family will be in danger&mdash;even the Princess herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean....&#8221; I began, excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I mean all the worst that may be in your
thoughts, Bergwyn. And neither you nor Petrosch
himself, nor anyone, might be able to save her in the
mad mood that would prevail in such a crisis. It
will be a very ugly time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think the other section will prevail?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>&#8220;Anything is possible in the present temper,
Bergwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; I exclaimed, intensely moved and
alarmed by the thoughts which this admission suggested.</p>

<p>For a few moments we were silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I ought to tell you why I thought you
had come here,&#8221; said Nikolitch, breaking the pause.
&#8220;Do you know there&#8217;s an old&mdash;old associate of yours
here? Her name now is the Baroness von Tulken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She came to me this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She gave me to understand you were coming
here on her account.&#8221;</p>

<p>I laughed. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t amount to anything what
she says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but she talks, Bergwyn, and&mdash;well, it&#8217;s none
of my affairs,&#8221; he broke off, and looked at me as if
inviting me to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her talk,&#8221; I answered, not accepting the invitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it isn&#8217;t anything to do with her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, nothing. I&#8217;ve told you the only reason why
I&#8217;m here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve got a devilish hard task, old
fellow. But if I can help in any way, use me. I
must go. I&#8217;ve duty on. What shall I tell Petrosch?&#8221;
and he rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I want the influence, and that to get it I&#8217;ll
do that business of the loan for the new Government&mdash;but
not if there&#8217;s to be any violence in establishing
it. Prepare him in that way and arrange for me to
see him to-morrow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>&#8220;Take my tip and tell him your motive, Bergwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll think it over,&#8221; I said; and after arranging to
see as much as possible of one another during my
stay in the capital we parted.</p>

<p>After he had gone I did think it over and saw one
thing clearly enough. I must secure the help and
influence of the army at any cost; as that promised
the most effective means of protecting Gatrina.</p>

<p>On the whole the talk with Nikolitch had the
result of restoring my confidence and raising my
hopes again. There were plenty of difficulties to be
overcome, of course; but if the army was resolved to
change the dynasty and was strong enough to force
that resolve upon the country, Gatrina&#8217;s chances in
regard to the succession were as good as dead; her
marriage with either Prince Albrevics or Duke Barinski
would be objectless, and then&mdash;well, she would
be free to choose for herself.</p>

<p>That was all I could ask for and I awaited the
interview with Colonel Petrosch with keen anticipation.</p>

<p>On the following morning Nikolitch came to report
that the Colonel had been suddenly called away,
however, and that he would come to see me the next
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything fresh occurred?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something is always occurring just now, Bergwyn.
But I fancy the Colonel has really gone to
avoid the reception at the Palace to-night. He
doesn&#8217;t wish to be present himself for one thing;
and for another, I fancy he wishes you to go there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
without having committed yourself to us. You&#8217;re to
be tackled, of course&mdash;the show is got up for that
purpose, I suppose&mdash;and crediting you with the
blunt methods of certain Americans, he thinks you
might feel impelled to tell the truth. We don&#8217;t work
in that crude way here, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled. &#8220;Did you say anything about the Princess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very little. I dropped a hint that you were
anxious about her safety. He made just the answer
I should have expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That he wished to Heaven she could be induced
to leave the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so do I; but I doubt it. You&#8217;ll be at the
Palace to-night, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I. My dear fellow, no. There&#8217;ll be no place for
small fry like me there. But I can tell you who will
be there;&#8221; and he rattled away with a lot of Court
gossip until I pulled him up.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing I have to do to-day, Nikolitch:
perhaps you can help me. I want to satisfy myself
from outside sources that the army can do all you
think. Whom should I see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must take it from us that we are united,
Bergwyn: for no one knows it. That the army, if
united, must be all powerful, you can learn from any
one anywhere. No one doubts it. Here, see these
people;&#8221; and he wrote down a number of names of
influential people in various positions.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the day prosecuting my inquiries;
and everywhere I went, I heard the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
verdict. That grave troubles were close at hand,
and that everything must turn upon the attitude of
the army. Of that no one entertained a shadow of
a doubt.</p>

<p>Nothing in all that strange time amazed me more
than the openness with which the plans of the opposing
parties were canvassed on all sides.</p>

<p>Everyone appeared to be agreed that a revolution
of some kind was actually impending. The attitude
of the two Great Powers concerned was matter
of free talk. Russia had been favoured under Milan;
Austrian influence had now the upper hand under
Alexander and his Queen. Austria was hopeful to
maintain the King; Russia resolved to countercheck
him and regain her former influence. The army
was speaking for the nation at large and equally opposed
to both the Powers.</p>

<p>These aims and the possible methods of attaining
them respectively seemed to be known to all; but
nowhere, save in her immediate circle, was a good
word, nay, scarcely a civil word, used toward the
Queen. The note everywhere was one of inveterate
hostility, almost of execration. And this was the
most sinister omen of all, not only as affecting her,
but as touching Gatrina also, of whom I heard many
harsh things said.</p>

<p>It was thus in a mood of troubled uneasiness that
I set out to attend the reception at the Palace, while
my private doubts as to how Gatrina would meet me
in my altered character added a special poignancy to
my anxiety and disquietude.</p>

<p>I made the most strenuous efforts to hold myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
well in hand and maintain complete self-restraint;
but when at length my eager eyes found her, my
heart began hammering against my ribs with quite
painful excitement, in which dread and delight were
almost equally mingled.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br />


<small>THE QUEEN&#8217;S ADVOCATE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The reception was outwardly a very brilliant affair
indeed, with multitudes of flashing lights, clever
colour effects, lavish decoration, and a prodigal
wealth of flowers, as the setting for the showy uniforms
of handsome men and the magnificent dresses
and jewels of pretty women.</p>

<p>One&#8217;s first impression was an irresistible tribute to
the perfect &aelig;sthetic triumph which had been
achieved. But that impression was only momentary.
Knowing as I did the cloud of peril which encircled
the whole court, the scene soon appeared to me to
be rather a ghastly mockery of Fate than a bit of
beautiful realism; and I caught myself wondering how
men could caper and jest and women smile and frivol
in pretended unconsciousness of everything but the
pleasure of the hour.</p>

<p>I recalled the chamberlain&#8217;s words of the day
before&mdash;that the whole thing was arranged in my
honour. <i>My</i> honour indeed! To kow-tow to the man
with the dollars! To bow the knee to mammon! To
fool and weedle me and dazzle me with a beautiful
farce gorgeously mounted, until I would loose the
strings of my own and my friend&#8217;s money bags, and
pour out the golden stream to enable this kind of
burlesque to be continued.</p>

<p>Then I caught sight of Gatrina and fell into a condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
of troubled anxiety and delicious anticipation
from which someone recalled me in order to present
me to their Majesties&mdash;the young King and that most
remarkable of women, Queen Draga.</p>

<p>I am not likely to forget that moment. The King
who, in obedience to one of those impulses of his
overpowering self-will had had courage to choose
his wife from among the people and was by nature,
I believe, a capable, clever and strong man, was overshadowed
by his magnificent Queen. Beautiful she
was not; the face was too strong, too powerful, too
imperious; and although she was grace personified,
in every movement and gesture of her perfectly-framed
figure, it was by the wonderful magnetism of
her personality that she dominated all who once
yielded to the magic influence she exercised.</p>

<p>The few words of greeting which she spoke to me,
welcoming me to Belgrade, and expressing the hope
that I liked the capital, were uttered with a charm
that made the merest commonplace phrase beautiful,
and endowed it with the point of significant meaning
of rare eloquence. At least so it all appeared to me
while my own words sounded awkward, clumsy and
crude in contrast.</p>

<p>I was replying to a question in this way when
Gatrina approached the Queen, and I saw her look at
me and start in intense surprise; flushing first and
then turning white as the gauze dress she wore, her
eyes unable to leave my face.</p>

<p>A few seconds passed while I went on with my
reply, rambling almost at random in my confusion
as I fought my way back to self-possession.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>The Queen noticed something in my manner, and
I saw the expression of her wonderful eyes change
for a fleeting instant until she dropped them and
appeared not to observe my confusion.</p>

<p>What I said I know not; but she smiled graciously
and saying that we should have another opportunity
of discussing the matter, turned to Gatrina.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must present you to one of my favourites, Mr.
Bergwyn, the Princess Gatrina. She is most kindly
disposed to all Americans, and will tell you all about
Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next moment I was bowing to Gatrina and the
King and Queen, and their circle moved away leaving
us together. I mumbled some commonplace about
being charmed to have such a guide. This was for
the benefit of those within earshot about us; and
before she could reply an interruption came.</p>

<p>Elma swept up, superbly dressed and full of confidence,
and held out her hand to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Bergwyn? I am glad to
see an old friend here. How pale you look, Gatrina.
Are you ill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you. The room is hot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so often the cause, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she replied,
with flagrant and almost insolent disbelief in the excuse.
&#8220;You must be careful, dear. You are not
strong since your terrible experience recently. Do
you know of the princess&#8217;s adventure and escape, Mr.
Bergwyn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have but just been presented to her, Baroness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I thought you had met before,&#8221; she exclaimed.
&#8220;Of course, I don&#8217;t know why&mdash;but then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
one never does know why one makes such mistakes,
does one? Let us go and sit down. You are such an
object of attention, Mr. Bergwyn, that you&#8217;ll be positively
mobbed if we stand here. It isn&#8217;t every day we
see an American millionaire in Belgrade where we&#8217;re
all as poor as mice in churches.&#8221;</p>

<p>She led the way to some seats, and not knowing
what else to do, we followed. She played with admirable
confidence. What she knew or guessed about that
time in the Bosnian hills, I could not tell, any more
than I could see her motive. But she seemed to
understand that she had us at a disadvantage and
made the most of it adroitly. She was resolved to
pose before Gatrina as an old friend of mine, and I
did not see how to stop her, although every word had
its barb for me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would be surprised, Mr. Bergwyn, and I
think you ought to be flattered, at the number of
people who wish to know you,&#8221; she said as soon as
we were seated. &#8220;The moment I said you were an
old friend of mine, I was pestered, literally pestered,
by people wanting to be introduced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here on business only, Baroness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, to-night you mean. Oh, yes, of course, I
know that. But you used to have a keen liking for
pleasure you know;&#8221; and she smiled as though she
knew a hundred secrets about me all elaborately dissipated
and disgraceful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not mean to-night,&#8221; I corrected. &#8220;I meant
my visit to Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, how very stupid of me. Why, it
might have sounded as if I meant that in speaking to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
Gatrina you would be thinking of business.&#8221; She
laughed with a sort of malicious gaiety. &#8220;How very
stupid I am. But then, we do call you the Queen&#8217;s
Advocate, don&#8217;t we, Gatrina?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Bergwyn may misunderstand you, Baroness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, not the least fear of that. We understand
one another perfectly, do we not, Mr. Bergwyn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way do you mean, Baroness?&#8221; I asked,
pointedly.</p>

<p>She took up the challenge readily and laughed,
quite joyously. &#8220;Why as old friends, old and intimate
friends ought to understand one another, of
course. What else should I mean?&#8221; Deny that old
friendship to Gatrina, if you dare, was in the look
she gave me.</p>

<p>&#8220;The seven years which have passed since we last
met, Baroness, have been the stern years of my life,&#8221;
I answered, for Gatrina&#8217;s benefit. &#8220;And in them I
have forgotten the follies of my childhood in the real
life of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a sage you must have become!&#8221; she
laughed; but the laugh was more palpably forced
than before. &#8220;Do you know,&#8221; she added, &#8220;I am just
dying to tell you of this adventure of Gatrina&#8217;s among
the brigands. May I, Gatrina?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It would not interest Mr. Bergwyn, nor
amuse me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the adventure in which the dog, Chris,
played a part; as I told you yesterday, Mr. Bergwyn.
Isn&#8217;t it an extraordinary coincidence, Gatrina, that
Mr. Bergwyn should have an immense dog, positively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
an immense creature of the same name, Chris? I
declare I&#8217;ve been thinking about it ever since I left
your house;&#8221; and she turned to me with a glance.
Her audacity increased with every fresh thrust she
made.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are many big dogs in the world, Baroness,
and not nearly enough names to go round. Thousands
of them must bear the same; and a dog is not
like us, you see, and cannot change its name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours is such a splendid creature, too,&#8221; she
said, ignoring this. &#8220;Huge, almost black, smooth-coated;
just the kind of dog you would love,
Gatrina.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make me curious. I must have an opportunity
of seeing it, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221; said Gatrina,
steadily, looking at me for the first time since I had
spoken to her. She was quite calm and self-collected
now, and Elma&#8217;s interposition had served one good
purpose. It had given us both time to get over the
surprise and confusion of the meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will give me great pleasure, Princess,&#8221; I answered
gravely. I understood, of course, that she
did not intend Elma to know the truth about the hill
business.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are feeling better again now, dear?&#8221; said
Elma, solicitously. &#8220;I am so glad. I wonder what
upset you. However, you have got over it, and that&#8217;s
the great thing. I suppose it <i>must</i> have been the heat
unless&#8221;&mdash;with a pause and a mischievous shrug of the
shoulders&mdash;&#8220;unless it was the shock of meeting Mr.
Bergwyn so unexpectedly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am obliged to you for the implied compliment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
Baroness. Do you think the Princess expected an
American citizen to wear a cowboy&#8217;s dress or a red
man&#8217;s war paint?&#8221; I laughed, and Gatrina joined me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I assure you, Mr. Bergwyn, the Baroness can
make the most wonderful mistakes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
did not understand for the moment what she meant
about your dog; but I believe I see it now. I do,
indeed.&#8221; She was a better actress than Elma after
all, and her merry laugh now was a most natural one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must plead my complete mystification, I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, you can both misunderstand,&#8221; said
Elma, spitefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really must tell you now, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221; declared
Gatrina; &#8220;although I said just now it would
not interest you. Elma has made it interesting and
quite amusing, although the adventure she speaks of
was very far from being amusing. You know there
are still some brigands left in the Bosnian and Herzogovinian
hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brigands?&#8221; I exclaimed in a tone of astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid we must admit it. Well, some of
them conceived the idea that if they carried me off
they would get a good ransom; and they did it. But
they did not get the ransom, for I escaped. After a
most exciting ride I was saved by a peasant with a
big dog, called Chris; and because you have a dog
of the same name, I really believe the baroness thinks
you must be a peasant in disguise of an American
millionaire. Isn&#8217;t it ingenious and clever of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not say anything of the kind,&#8221; snapped
Elma, viciously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>&#8220;Of course, we have tried to let as little as possible
get known of the matter, Mr. Bergwyn, but this
delicious theory of the baroness&#8217;s has made such a
joke of it, that really I think I must tell everybody
now. Would you mind if I were to say plainly that
you are not an American gentleman but a Bosnian
peasant, and that I know that to be true because you
have a big dog called Chris? It&#8217;s such a convincing
reason, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything that would associate me with you,
Princess, would be a pleasure,&#8221; I returned, with a
bow and a smile, as if I were paying her a mere conventional
compliment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are trying to make me appear very ridiculous,
Gatrina,&#8221; exclaimed Elma, angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare I shall tell the Queen and get her to let
us have a tableau in which I should be the maiden in
distress, and you the peasant rescuer, Mr. Bergwyn.
You could get a very picturesque dress, you know;
and I am sure you could play the part. But to make
it complete we ought to have the baroness in, because
it&#8217;s her idea; and yet I don&#8217;t see what part to give
her,&#8221; and Gatrina laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I can offer a suggestion,&#8221; said I, deliberately.
&#8220;We could reverse the thing; and instead
of the Baroness being the one to discover the truth,
let her have planned your abduction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elma started, her eyes flashed with sudden anger
at me, and she changed colour.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter, Baroness? You are not
well,&#8221; said Gatrina with a startled glance at me, followed
by a searching look at Elma&#8217;s white confusion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>&#8220;It is my turn to feel the heat,&#8221; she replied, trying
to force a laugh. &#8220;Really, Mr. Bergwyn, I shall
begin to be afraid you have some effect on the atmosphere.
First it upset Gatrina, and now me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not like my suggestion, I see. I will
withdraw it,&#8221; I answered, quietly. &#8220;Pray pardon
me.&#8221; Gatrina sat thinking hard; and I guessed I had
started the line of thought. &#8220;It is a curious thing,&#8221;
I went on, as if merely to cover the pause; &#8220;but I
have had more than one experience of the kind. I
mean where I have been in conversation with people
and suddenly, without any palpable cause, they have
been overcome&mdash;by the atmosphere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be a dangerous man,&#8221; laughed Elma,
who was quickly recovering herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not dangerous, I trust, to&mdash;my friends&#8221;; and I
bowed and smiled, and gave her a look which she
understood.</p>

<p>We were interrupted then by someone who came
from the Queen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her Majesty desires me to remind your Highness
that the dancing is about to commence,&#8221; he said to
Gatrina, and added to Elma, &#8220;Her Majesty desires
to speak with you at once, Baroness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elma rose. &#8220;I suppose I am interfering with your
business and so am ordered away,&#8221; she said with a
sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you give me a dance, Princess?&#8221; I asked.
The moment we were alone the feeling of restraint
was revived.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is by the Queen&#8217;s desire,&#8221; she answered, with
a shrug as she put the tips of her fingers on my arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
and I led her away. It was a waltz and we danced it
in silence. At the close I did not know what she
would wish to do, and as I hesitated, she said suddenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we must keep up the pretence. We
are to go through into the further conservatory.&#8221;
The place was empty save for a couple of chairs making
a sort of cosy corner; and as I guessed the arrangement
was of the Queen&#8217;s making, I blessed her
for her unwitting thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>Gatrina was very pale, and as she sat down she exclaimed
impulsively:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is almost maddening. You might have spared
me this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is maddening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please not to pretend you don&#8217;t understand.
That can only make matters worse than they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand that I wish very urgently to speak
to you; but if you would prefer another time, I will
go;&#8221; and I got up.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so force me to give some false explanation
to the Queen of what I cannot explain truly. Thank
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat down again. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we clear the air a bit?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Having done this miserable thing you pretend
not to know what it is. I suppose you can see that
all this is arranged. That I was to dance with you,
make myself agreeable to you, bring you here where
we could be undisturbed, and then talk you into
carrying out this miserable loan. You can see that
surely, as clearly as you can see how successful you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
have been in humiliating me. You must be very glad
and proud of your success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if you didn&#8217;t plan it, why didn&#8217;t you let me
know why you were coming to Belgrade? Why not
tell me who you were really? Why not give me time
and means to avoid you? Oh, it is intolerable! You
knew I was to play jackal for the Queen with the
American money-man. Elma herself told you I was
what she calls the Queen&#8217;s advocate. Ugh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to hear you speak of the Baroness
von Tulken by her Christian name, as if she were your
friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it one of the conditions of your financial business
that you control the friendships of the Court of
Belgrade?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was unreasonably angry, and, of course,
abominably unjust.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you do me that injustice? I
could not possibly know that the Queen would intentionally
throw us together, and as for humiliation&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew it yesterday. The Baroness&mdash;Elma,
told you so.&#8221; I smiled at the aggressive way in
which she paused and threw up her head as she made
the correction in the name; and the smile irritated
her to still further anger. &#8220;I dislike evasion and
pretence, Mr. Bergwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>I winced a bit under the lash of her words, and
paused; and just at that moment my memory played
me a prank. That scene at the camp when we had
our first sharp will contest leapt suddenly into my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
thoughts, and when her face had worn pretty much
the same resolute angry expression. Then I leaned
back in my chair and replied very deliberately:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just where you&#8217;re wrong, I think. If
you knew anything about me you&#8217;d know I like evasion
and pretence and falsehood. The man who can
do a dirty unmanly trick in the dirtiest and most selfish
way is just my type; and if he can do it to a
woman&mdash;in the way I&#8217;ve done it to you, for instance&mdash;he&#8217;s
my hero. Of course, he must be a big sort of
brute; cunning, despicable, and mean; a clever beast
at getting women into a false position so that he can
enjoy a laugh to himself by making them suffer&mdash;and
the more they suffer the more he hugs himself.
You know the kind of man; you must, because from
what you&#8217;ve said about me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to hear any more about your ideals,
thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was only filling in the details to your rough
outline. But what I want you to understand is, your
outline is right and that you have just such a brute to
deal with in me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer for quite a time and sat tearing
to pieces nervously a leaf she had plucked from a
plant near.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not say anything of the kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see it&#8217;s this way,&#8221; I said, not heeding her
words. &#8220;I came to Belgrade to humiliate you, to
insult you, to trample&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221; she cried, quickly.</p>

<p>I threw up my hands as one who is aggrieved.
&#8220;You won&#8217;t let me tell you the truth, you see. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
think it&#8217;s a little hard on me, anyway. A man doesn&#8217;t
get many chances of complete self-revelation; and I
was just enjoying&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She was looking straight out in front of her and
turned her head with one swift glance that stopped
my banter. I broke off and said very earnestly:</p>

<p>&#8220;If I did not come for that purpose then I came to
serve you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not have come at all. You cannot
serve me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary I have already done so. I know
what you do not&mdash;the reason behind your&mdash;behind
the supposed brigand business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard what part I suggested for the Baroness
von Tulken in the tableau. She would know
how to play the part to the life.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat up suddenly and faced me, her features
flushed and her eyes eager.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you think you know this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think. I know. The scheme was laid
here in Belgrade, and the men who carried it out
were hired and paid by the Duke Barinski. I can
produce the men who will identify him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be. How did you learn it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money; and the aid of a staunch friend of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend of mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Karasch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Karasch? Karasch.&#8221; She repeated the name in
a tone of reminiscence, very gentle and low, and
putting her hand to her eyes sat back as if in dismay
or pleasure at the associations connected with it. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
a moment afterwards the emotion, whether pleasure
or pain, passed, and her face, as she took her hand
from it and sat up again, was colder and sterner than
I had ever seen it.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you connect the Baroness with this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, and can prove it.&#8221; Her eyes hardened and
her lip curled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I congratulate you upon your manliness, Mr.
Bergwyn. I know the real reason for your presence
in Belgrade; the Baroness told me that: your old and
intimate friend whom you are now maligning in this
chivalrous way.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then I knew that Elma had, indeed, been talking
about that old time; and I understood many
things; amongst them the mess of mischief she had
brewed for me.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.<br />


<small>A DECLARATION OF WAR.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The position was so full of ludicrous absurdity owing
to the monstrous distortion of my motives, and
yet so embarrassing in my inability to explain things
without going into the whole matter of my past relations
with Elma, that I did not know whether to
laugh at the absurdity or be angry at the injustice.
I was angry and yet I wanted to laugh; but that did
not help me to find a reply to Gatrina&#8217;s scornfully delivered
indictment.</p>

<p>My silence and apparent confusion made the
matter worse. Every second that I hesitated seemed
to increase her indignation; and I could not help
perceiving that my influence was running down so
fast that it would soon be many degrees below zero.</p>

<p>My first attempt to remedy the matter was
unfortunate.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have got suddenly on to very delicate
ground, Princess, but I can only say that I did not
know the Baroness was in Belgrade when I resolved
to come here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That means that you give the lie to a woman
behind her back, Mr. Bergwyn; and that woman my
friend and also an old friend of yours.&#8221; Cold, contemptuous
and cutting in every syllable, her words
hurt me to the quick.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;Pardon me, you must not twist my words. I am
telling you no more than the truth and no less. If
the Baroness told you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>If?</i>&#8221; she broke in, indignantly. &#8220;Then it is <i>my</i>
word you question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; that again has never entered my thoughts.
The shortest plan will be for me to go in search of
the Baroness and bring her here that this may be explained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no need, thank you. It is not sufficiently
important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you tell me what she said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Bergwyn, I am not a talebearer,&#8221; she
answered with a quick shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;You allow other people to carry tales to you.
But that perhaps is your interpretation of consistency.
Do you believe what I told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we change the subject, Mr. Bergwyn? I
hope your impressions of Belgrade, so far as the
scenery is concerned, have been pleasant.&#8221; Her assumption
of courtesy was excellent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe what I told you that I came here
without knowing of the presence of the Baroness von
Tulken?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The views from the higher grounds are considered
to be among the finest in Europe. Have you
seen them?&#8221;</p>

<p>I rose from my seat. &#8220;I will fetch the Baroness,&#8221;
I said, bluntly.</p>

<p>She paused, got up, and looking straight at me,
said icily:</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you not find some other opportunity to tell
her what to say?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>I caught my breath with the pain of this and bit
my lip as I gripped the back of my chair tightly. I
think she must have seen something of what I suffered
in that moment. Then I bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no answer to that, Princess. I shall leave
Belgrade to-night for good. Of that you may now
rest assured. Shall I take you back to the ballroom?&#8221;</p>

<p>But instead of placing her hand on the arm I
offered, she sat down again and turned her face away
from me. I stood a few moments in some hesitation
and then said: &#8220;I bid you farewell, Princess;&#8221; and
walked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221; she called, when I had taken
some half dozen paces. I stopped and turned. &#8220;I
wish to speak to you.&#8221; She spoke without looking
at me. I retraced my steps and stood by my former
seat. Some moments of tense silence followed.</p>

<p>I broke the silence. &#8220;This has become very embarrassing
to me, Princess; but I have decided upon
my course. There are some things I have to tell you,
but with your permission I will write them and send
them by Karasch whom you can question as to the
truth of that part of them which he knows. I recognise
now the mistake I made in coming to the
capital, and I will remedy it at once. I can easily
find a pretext for my sudden departure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. You must not go. Please, sit down. Don&#8217;t
you understand that we are probably being watched,
although not overheard.&#8221;</p>

<p>I resumed my seat then; and again we were silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are angry at what I said?&#8221; she asked at
length.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>&#8220;No. It was much too terrible to cause mere
anger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not wish to give you pain.&#8221; Her face was
still averted from me, and when I did not reply, she
turned and looked swiftly at me. &#8220;I was angry but
I&mdash;I did not mean it, Mr. Bergwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad to hear that. Shall we leave it
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish to humble me and force me to say that
I am ashamed of the words?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God forbid I should have such a thought. But
you appear so incapable of doing me anything but
injustice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not; but the position is so impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only if you make it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to believe in you, but&mdash;&#8221; she threw up her
hands and sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you would do so, it would make all the difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in such sore trouble that you cannot understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I think I know more of the
trouble than you yourself. I know the motive of
the Queen in regard to your marriage with Prince
Albrevics.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started with sudden agitation. &#8220;You, a
stranger to Servia, have heard that. Tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Prince is impossible as a ruler for the country;
not a hundred men in the country would bear
with him on the throne; and in that case your own
claim would be sacrificed. She would have you
make the marriage for that reason&mdash;that her own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
plans in regard to her brother&#8217;s succession may be
helped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is what they have told me. It has
come like a terrible and sudden blow. How did
you hear it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not from one source only, but several. It is the
common knowledge of those who understand these
things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot believe it; I cannot. She is goodness
itself to me, and has always been my friend. To me
more than a sister; and I love her and trust her as
one. I cannot believe it!&#8221; Her distress and pain
as she spoke were intense. &#8220;They tell me that even
now she and the King are prepared with the proclamation
in favour of her brother, and only wait
for my marriage to issue it. But it cannot be true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only tell you what I am assured is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What am I to do? Whom can I trust if not
the best friend I have ever had?&#8221; She spoke almost
wildly in her agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;If as you think we are being observed, Princess,
may I counsel you to shew less feeling and excitement?
Let me speak while you collect yourself. You
must face the position calmly, for there is yet another
danger that threatens you. There is a scheme
to marry you to the Duke Barinski&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know of that, too!&#8221; she interposed. &#8220;How
do you learn all these secrets?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me put a question to you,&#8221; I said, as a
thought occurred to me. &#8220;Who told you of the
Queen&#8217;s intentions in regard to Prince Albrevics?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot tell you that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>&#8220;Then I will tell you. It was the Baroness von
Tulken.&#8221; There was no need for her to say in words
that my guess was right. Her start and glance did
that.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am almost afraid of you,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish that; but I would rather have fear
than mistrust. These things have been told to me
plainly by those who seek to get the money I am able
to control. It was only a guess that the Baroness
had told you; and I will give you her motive. She
desires to influence you to marry the Duke Barinski
under the pretence that the marriage would reconcile
the rival interests of the two contending families, and,
having Russia behind it, would render the throne
secure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her surprise at my knowledge of these things
was so great that it appeared to dwarf the significance
of the news itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is wonderful,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wonder is rather that while so many people
know of all this, you yourself have remained ignorant
of it so long. Can you bear that I tell you still
more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there more to tell? I am already filled with
amazement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the intentions of the army leaders?
I mean so far as they affect you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Affect me, Mr. Bergwyn? They cannot affect me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your eyes and ears have been dulled by the conditions
and restrictions of the Court life. What I tell
you is now for your hearing alone. The army will
declare against the family of which you are a member,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
and will change the succession to the Throne.
When that moment comes it will be fraught with
peril to you in common with all the Obrenovics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, the army is loyal. I have heard whispers
of some such treachery; but there is no ground for
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I know is the Court view&mdash;mine is the true
one.&#8221; I spoke as deliberately and impressively as I
could.</p>

<p>&#8220;This very question has been discussed at the
Palace within the last few days, a warning to the
same effect was conveyed to the King and Queen;
but they have made wide and searching inquiries;
and we know there is no ground whatever to doubt
the army&#8217;s loyalty. You have been misinformed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there were any reason to doubt it, I should not
speak positively, Princess; but there is none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you wish to frighten me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish only that you shall know the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if all you say were true, do you realise what
my position would be and what my duty would be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is because I realise the peril that encircles you
that I speak so plainly. All the parties concerned&mdash;the
Court, the army and the Russian&mdash;are struggling
for their own objects; and however that struggle may
end, you stand to lose all. If the Court wins, you will
be set aside; if the Russian, you might gain the throne
for a while, but the country would be convulsed by
a revolution; if the army win, then as a possible
Obrenovic claimant to the Throne, you would be
an obstacle in their path and can judge what your
position might then be.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>She sat thinking intently. &#8220;If you are right, then
there is no one about me whom I can trust,&#8221; she
said, slowly. &#8220;Everything is a sham and everyone
I have believed in false. Do you wish me to think
this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know all those whom you trust; but
that you need someone to advise you in such a crisis
is but too clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think I am helpless because I am a girl, I
suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let us slur this thing with personal consideration.
It is far too grave, Princess. Of the
Queen&#8217;s intentions I can give you no proofs; but of
the other dangers, I believe I can. Will you let me
try? Can you bring yourself to be at my house to-morrow
at midday?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at me in blank astonishment at the suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can bring with you anyone who is in your
confidence. It is open to you as one in the Queen&#8217;s
confidence to leave a card upon me. That will serve
as an excuse, if you do not consider the issues too
grave to be subject to any mere conventions. I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it were anyone else who proposed such a
thing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is not,&#8221; I interposed; &#8220;so don&#8217;t refuse at
once. If you do not come you can send me word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I trust you,&#8221; she said with the old
simple directness, to my intense delight. &#8220;But there
are so many reasons&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused. &#8220;I know that,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;But believe
me they are nothing compared with those which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
should weigh with you. I shall hope to get you
proofs of the army&#8217;s intentions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must leave that to my contriving.&#8221; At that
moment I became aware that someone was coming
quickly toward us through the conservatory between
us and the ballroom. &#8220;Someone is coming. Take
no notice,&#8221; I whispered rapidly, and then in a loud
tone: &#8220;I shall carefully consider all you have said,
Princess, and thank you for your patience with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the rare palm, Prince. Oh, someone is
here.&#8221; It was Elma&#8217;s voice, and she added with
gentle spite: &#8220;Why, it is Gatrina and Mr. Bergwyn.
I thought you had gone an hour ago. I am so sorry
to intrude. Come, Prince, let us go back. We are
in the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least, Baroness,&#8221; I answered. I had
risen and saw that her companion was Prince Albrevics,
and further that he was partially intoxicated.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been looking for you everywhere,
Gatrina,&#8221; he said in a surly tone, his voice a little
thick and unsteady with liquor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been here by the Queen&#8217;s desire,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ve been long enough, and can come
away by mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been a handsome man in his day, and his
figure still retained something of soldierly strength
and uprightness. But the features had the heavy,
sodden look of dissipation.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have finished our conference, I think, Mr.
Bergwyn?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>&#8220;How very fortunate we just timed our coming
not to disturb them, Prince, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Elma,
with a sweet, significant smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think we have finished, Princess;&#8221; and
with a bow to me she put her arm on his and went
away.</p>

<p>Elma laughed loudly enough for all to hear; and
when I turned to her she met my look with a glance
of studied defiance.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be careful of him, Mr. Bergwyn. He
is a very jealous man, passionately devoted to
Gatrina and&mdash;one of the only real swordsmen in
Servia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you sit down a moment. I have something
to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I take dear Gatrina&#8217;s place? Do you really
think I am worthy to fill it?&#8221; she asked in spiteful
banter.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; I answered, brutally. I couldn&#8217;t
help it in my vexation. &#8220;But I wish to speak to
you alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just like old times, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; She laughed, as
she settled herself comfortably in the chair and
looked smilingly at me, as though we were about
to have a chat on the terms of the most confidential
friendship. As I did not speak at once, she affected
nervousness and said with a pout: &#8220;You look dreadfully
stern. If you are going to be disagreeable, I
shall not stay. I want you to be like your old self.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to say something that should please
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At last? Oh, that will be delightful,&#8221; she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
rapturously; but her eyes were full of doubt,
surprise and suspicion. &#8220;You have not said a single
nice thing to me since you came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But before I say it, let me request you not to
make any incorrect statement as to the reasons for
my coming to Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Incorrect? What have I said that is incorrect?&#8221;
she cried with innocent surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I came, not on business, but to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only told Gatrina,&#8221; she said, laughing coquettishly,
as though she had the right to tell the world
if she pleased; and then added with significant insinuation:
&#8220;You must have got very intimate with
her if she told you my secrets. I&#8217;m afraid I shall
really have to warn the Queen that you are a dangerous
man for her advocate to be on such confidential
terms with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not discussing that. I am merely asking
you not to repeat that statement to anyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t it true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. And you know it is not,&#8221; I replied bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I am lost in amazement. You certainly did
not come on the business of the loan; you are much
to shrewd for that. And if you didn&#8217;t come to see
me, whom did you come to see?&#8221; A most excellent
assumption of surprise veiled this thrust.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came as an American financier, Baroness, looking
after my own interests.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she laughed and shook her finger at me. &#8220;Fie,
Mr. Bergwyn, fie. I did not look to you, the apostle
of stolid truth, for such a statement.&#8221; Then with a
change to reflective seriousness. &#8220;If it was not for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
me, then it must have been for Gatrina. That&#8217;s
why I told her what I did and gave her a peep, just
a little peep, into the past. But I have not shewn
her your letters&mdash;yet. Not one of them; not even
the least impressive of them. I could not do that;
they are all sacred in my eyes. My most precious possessions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your object in all this&mdash;this burlesque?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reduced to plain direct questions are you now?
But don&#8217;t you think you could answer that yourself?
I&#8217;ll give you one answer. I want you on my side and
I don&#8217;t intend, if I can help it, to let the Queen&#8217;s advocate
win you over for the Queen. No, I don&#8217;t;
although she has the advantage of having been rescued
by you. You needn&#8217;t try and look as if that
were not true; because it is, and I know that it is.
And if you think a moment you will see what a
service I am rendering her in letting people think
you came here for my sake. Think of the scandal it
would cause if it were known that you, the American
man of millions, had rescued her and then followed
her to Belgrade. It would ruin her&mdash;and people are
very particular about reputations in this Court. The
Queen is obliged to be on account of her own past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you know how the Princess came to be
in need of a rescuer?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed again lightly. I was growing to hate
her laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I do, seeing that Duke Barinski and I
planned it all. The marriage with him would have
taken place in Maglai, if she had not, most unfortunately
for us, escaped.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>&#8220;You are very frank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not. You have probably told her already
that that brigand story was a fable and that we were
at the bottom of it all. You shewed me you knew
it all, this evening; and I don&#8217;t think so poorly of
you as to dream you had not got proofs which satisfied
you. I know what money can do in Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Russian money, you mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Russian money, or any other,&#8221; she returned,
parrying my thrust with the lightest air of
indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has not bought the support of the army for
this Russian scheme of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I heard that Colonel Petrosch&#8217;s jackal, Captain
Nikolitch, had been closeted with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You take a deep concern in my movements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel a deep interest in all that affects you. But
you know that. Besides, it is my business to learn
things. We have many agents, and Belgrade is only
a small place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Agents?&#8221; I said hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Agents or spies. I will call them spies, if you
prefer. The point is that we have them&mdash;everywhere.
I am one if you like. They form one of the main institutions
of government in the Balkans. And in the
Servian army they abound in all ranks and all regiments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever I have thought of you I have never
pictured you as a Russian spy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bit her lip and clenched her hands and her
cheek flushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very easy for a millionaire to sneer,&#8221; she retorted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
speaking deliberately; then with rising passion,
she continued: &#8220;What would you have had
me do? God knows I had little enough choice. I
was an adventuress, living on my wits; a cheat if you
will to keep my mother and myself from the gutter.
Then I was detected; and wherever I looked, the
finger of contempt met me. What chance had I? I
took the only thing that offered&mdash;a husband; my
looks, as I thought, gave me that; and I found him&mdash;what?
A Russian spy. But it was not my looks
he sought but my brains, my courage, my recklessness.
I could do the work, and do it well; and
when he died I was in too deeply to withdraw.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and her bosom laboured with her
vehemence.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t pretend&mdash;to you. I could have withdrawn,
of course, had I wished. But I did not, for
it gave me not only all that a woman is supposed to
care for, dress, money, and influence; but also what
a woman is not supposed to crave&mdash;power. I was
feared; and it is by fear I stand where I do. I could
have married again, not once but a dozen times; I
have been wooed until men cried that I was ice. And
to them I was. What were men or marriage to me?
I had tried marriage; and as for my heart, it lay in my
breast like a dead thing&mdash;for the sake of the past.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked searchingly at me as I made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not acting now. I was when I first came
to you yesterday; hoping or fearing I know not which
or what. I have had to learn to act to play any part
at will. To fawn, to coquet, to jest, to lure, to lie,
to appear false when I was true, and true when I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
false. A spy must learn these things&mdash;they are the
tricks of the life. But I will not lie to you. That I
promise you. I have told you all plainly that you
may know me for what I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had risen in the hope of stopping her. &#8220;I beg
you to say no more,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not quite finished. Please sit again. I
have to speak of you and Gatrina&mdash;the Queen&#8217;s advocate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather you say nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a purpose in telling you the truth. You
have to take a side either with or against me. If
you are against me, I will fight you fairly&mdash;but I will
use every weapon I have. I know that you came
here to follow Gatrina; I know that you saved her;
my instinct tells me why you followed her&mdash;and I
tell you bluntly, she can be nothing to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I neither accept nor deny any conclusions you
draw,&#8221; I said, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need no confirmation from you. I have questioned
Gatrina. I knew how it was with her before
you came; and when I left your house yesterday,
your dog gave me the clue to everything. We have
agents even in Samac and Poabja, Mr. Bergwyn; and
when your man Karasch was traced to your house&mdash;after
a week spent in inquiries here in Belgrade&mdash;the
rest was easy. The telegraph runs to Samac; and
Poabja is but a short hour&#8217;s ride from there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so bitter against the Princess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not bitter against her&mdash;unless you force me.
She must act in the Russian interest&mdash;that means
she must marry Duke Barinski. But I have other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
motives, private and personal, far stronger than
those of policy, that make me tell you you must not
and shall not think of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what do you seek from me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may join with us in effecting that marriage,
or you may not, as you please. But what you must
do is to convince Gatrina beyond question that your
coming here has no connection whatever with what
passed at the time you rescued her. I have prepared
the way for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very thoughtful, no doubt, but I don&#8217;t
understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told her that once we were betrothed and
that you have come here in search of me. You can
confirm that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By renewing the old relations&mdash;for the time&mdash;and
making the matter public.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You want me to act that lie in order to deceive
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To convince her of the necessity of marrying the
Duke Barinski.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had to clench my teeth to keep my indignation
under.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not do it,&#8221; I said, clipping the words short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we are to fight, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221; she said,
as she rose. &#8220;I shall find other means and take
further steps. I shall poison her against you, if I
have to shew her your letters in proof of what I told
her. Will you give me your arm? I am sorry you
make me your enemy and hers&mdash;it may mean danger
for her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>&#8220;We will see,&#8221; I replied; and having led her back
to the ballroom I got away from the Palace as soon
as I could, to think over the latest and most strange
development of the situation.</p>

<small>PRINCE ALBREVICS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>When I came to think over that promise to
Gatrina, to furnish proofs of the army&#8217;s intentions,
I felt I had sawn off a log which I might find too
big to haul. And the thought made me considerably
uneasy.</p>

<p>I had given the pledge in a moment of excitement;
and now that I was cool, the difficulty of keeping
it looked very formidable indeed.</p>

<p>It troubled me a good deal more than the frank
declaration of war from Elma&mdash;although that promised
quite sufficient embarrassments of its own. That
she would keep her word I had no doubt; and I
might gamble on it that she would do her worst.</p>

<p>Yet in one respect it cleared my course. There
was no longer any sort of use in finessing with the
Russian party. Elma knew too much for me to
think of being able to deceive her; while her preposterous
condition that there should be a sham
renewal of our old engagement was too repugnant
and preposterous to be entertained for an instant.</p>

<p>Neither was there any thought of coquetting with
the Court. That involved apparent acquiescence in
the scheme for Gatrina&#8217;s marriage; the very thing
I was firmly bent upon stopping at any cost.</p>

<p>I was thus confirmed in my decision of the previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
day to secure the influence of the army, and to trust
to that to carry me through. But it was just in that
respect I had increased my difficulties by the pledge
to Gatrina. I could only keep it by getting Colonel
Petrosch to back up my statement to her; and here
was the trouble.</p>

<p>I recalled Nikolitch&#8217;s advice to speak plainly to the
Colonel about Gatrina; but it was the one subject of
all others which I was altogether disinclined to discuss
with him.</p>

<p>And the disinclination was strengthened when he
and Nikolitch arrived; for he looked about the last
individual in the world whom I would have chosen
for a confidence of the kind.</p>

<p>His appearance impressed me mainly with a sense
of cold, inflexible, unsympathetic strength and capacity.
He was a hatchet-headed man in the fifties, with
a long, narrow, keen, undemonstrative face; one of
those straight, thin-lipped mouths which seem intended
for the close guardianship of secrets; and an
abnormally long heavy chin which suggested resolute
purpose, dogged persistence and perhaps cruelty;
while his piercing, hard, close-set eyes tended to confirm
this suggestion of cruelty. Altogether he was
capable of being an ugly enemy.</p>

<p>He was sparing of words in the interview; and
whatever he had guessed as to the real motives of
my presence in Belgrade he was careful to let no
hint of it appear; and he went straight to the pith
of our meeting.</p>

<p>He expressed great pleasures in seeing me, gave
Nikolitch a word of praise for his share in having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
brought the meeting about, said he understood I
wished to secure the influence of the army in certain
eventualities, and then asked me point blank whether
I meant to help the existing Government financially.</p>

<p>I answered guardedly that I was not as yet satisfied
of the present stability of things, but that when there
was a really stable Government I should be prepared
to guarantee a loan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you regard as sufficiently stable a new
Government having the united army at its back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if founded without violence and commanding
the support of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought this over a moment. &#8220;It is all we can
ask,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Will you put that in writing, Mr.
Bergwyn?&#8221;</p>

<p>I assented, and he immediately placed materials
before me and waited in silence while I wrote out an
undertaking on the lines I had indicated. This I read
aloud to him, and he marked every word, suggesting
one or two trifling alterations. I made these and then
held the paper ready to hand to him. I did this to
convince him I was earnest; and then I opened up
the other matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I give you this it amounts to a pledge that
I take the side of the army, Colonel Petrosch. What
am I to receive in exchange?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think I understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are gaining much by this agreement&mdash;the
assurance that the financial help required by the
Government will not be found by me. To be candid
I want something in return.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever the committee of officers can in fairness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
pledge the new Government to do, they will&mdash;but
you will be able to make your terms then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want the assistance of your party now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend Nikolitch has told you I am especially
concerned for the safety of the Princess Gatrina.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Not the ghost of a feeling even of interest
did he shew.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to be assured of her safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There can be no difficulty in giving such an assurance,&#8221;
he answered after a moment&#8217;s thought.
&#8220;So far as I am personally concerned I would do my
utmost. But you have some further question to put,
I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is, I think, coming here to-day. I wish her
to be convinced of the feeling of the army, and that
the officers are unanimously resolved upon their
course of action.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause, and I saw Nikolitch glance at
me in astonishment and from me to the Colonel.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a very grave request, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221; said
Petrosch slowly. &#8220;Do you realise that you are asking
me, one of the leaders of the army, to reveal our
intentions to one of the Queen&#8217;s closest friends?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are gaining much from this&mdash;&#8221; and I held
up the paper&mdash;&#8220;I am gaining nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear I cannot do it, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221; he said, reluctantly.
&#8220;I might be very gravely compromised,
to say nothing of the risk to be run.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What risk?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That the news would be carried straight to the
Queen.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>&#8220;It has been carried already,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was at the Palace last night and I heard from
one who has ample means of knowledge, that the
plans of the army had been divulged to the Court,
and that diligent inquiries had been made in consequence.
That risk is therefore nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean there are traitors amongst us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I deem it extremely probable,&#8221; I said, drily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot think where?&#8221; he declared after a
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it the practice of traitors to advertise themselves?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is very grave news&mdash;very grave, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not perhaps so grave as you think&mdash;for the result
of the inquiries made was to satisfy the Court of
the loyalty of the army as a whole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t talk just for talk&#8217;s sake, Colonel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it would be very different if I myself were
to see the Princess. No, I fear I cannot do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. Then I&#8217;ll tear up this paper and we&#8217;ll
call the matter off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are asking too much of me, Mr. Bergwyn.
I must have time to consult others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never change my terms, Colonel Petrosch.
You decide yes or no, right now, or I must seek other
means.&#8221;</p>

<p>He leant back in dire perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would disclose no plans, merely give proofs
that the feeling of the army is solid; and what you
said would be received under a pledge of confidence.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>&#8220;What is your object?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My sole purpose in coming to Belgrade is to
secure her safety, Colonel; and you can therefore
judge how far I am prepared to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess is one of our grave embarrassments,
Mr. Bergwyn. If anything I could say would
enable you to influence her to leave Belgrade for a
time, it would be different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have little influence, I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>He threw up his hands and shook his head, and
was silent.</p>

<p>During the pause Buller brought me a card. It
was Gatrina&#8217;s. She had come after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess is here, Colonel, and with your
leave I will go to her. I&#8217;ll send my man in ten minutes,
and you can say just yes or no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will secure the pledge of secrecy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Otherwise I will not ask you to say a word.&#8221;</p>

<p>It looked as if I were going to win, after all, and
I felt in a confident mood as I hurried to Gatrina,
giving Buller his instructions on the way.</p>

<p>An elderly woman was with her, at whom I glanced
with little interest as the name, the Countess Vashti,
was mentioned.</p>

<p>Gatrina met me with a stiff ceremonious bow; and
her voice was cold and hard. But her eyes were full
of trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;We come by the Queen&#8217;s desire, Mr. Bergwyn, to
bid you a formal welcome to Belgrade on her and
His Majesty&#8217;s behalf,&#8221; she said, formally and distantly.</p>

<p>I expressed my gratification in equally formal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
terms; and we sat talking generalities, about the
Capital, the ball of the previous night, and so on;
just commonplace surface chatter, until Buller entered
and gave me a slip of paper with the one word
&#8220;Yes&#8221; written upon it. I had won; and after a little
more make-weight twaddle for the benefit of the
Countess Vashti, I got to the pith of things.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some points arising out of our conversation
at the Palace, last night, Princess, which have
occurred to me, and I should be glad of an opportunity
of discussing them with you privately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her Majesty&#8217;s object in desiring me to see you
to-day, Mr. Bergwyn, was that I should speak with
you privately if you desired it.&#8221; As she said this she
glanced at the companion, who bowed acquiescence.</p>

<p>I rose at once and giving the old lady a bundle of
papers I led Gatrina to another room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you last night that I would endeavour to
give you proofs of what I said. As to the aim of the
Russian party there is no need for proof; the Baroness
herself last night admitted to me that she had
instigated your abduction; that you were to have
been taken to Maglai; and that when there your marriage
with Duke Barinski was to be forced upon
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has said almost as much to me to-day&mdash;among
other things,&#8221; was her reply, very coldly
spoken. I could guess at the &#8220;other things,&#8221; but
there was no time then to enter upon any defence.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the power and feeling of the army I can
prove my words. Colonel Petrosch is here and he
will himself convince you. Will you come to him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>&#8220;It seems incredible. How have you prevailed
upon him to speak of this to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does that matter, so long as he does speak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be at liberty to report what he may say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, certainly not. It is for your ears only. You
asked for the proofs of what I said. I offer it to you;
but it must, of course, be under a pledge of secrecy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated in anxious perplexity. &#8220;I will see
him. I can at any rate act upon any knowledge so
gained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for that object I wish you to be convinced.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went then to the room where I had left the
Colonel and Nikolitch, and both men rose and bowed
to Gatrina as we entered, the Colonel stiffly, Nikolitch
with unmistakable interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time is pressing and the interview need not take
long,&#8221; I said. &#8220;What I wish is that you will convince
the Princess Gatrina as you have convinced
me, Colonel Petrosch, of the intentions of the officers
for whom you speak so far as they affect her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gatrina sat down and looked at him very closely.</p>

<p>The Colonel on his side was not without embarrassment
as to how to begin. At length he said:
&#8220;The Princess will, no doubt, be aware that the
family of which she is a member has incurred the extreme
hostility of the army. And what I said to you
before, Mr. Bergwyn, I repeat now&mdash;if the Princess
consults her safety and interests she will leave the
country at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gatrina&#8217;s lip curled. &#8220;And if she does not consult
either by adopting a course which she would
consider cowardly and consent to be frightened away,
what then?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>Antagonism and disbelief inspired the reply:
the antagonism founded upon the Court view of the
army&#8217;s attitude; the disbelief proceeding from her
own private feelings. Nikolitch pulled his moustache
and glanced at her with a mixture of admiration and
concern; while the grim old Colonel shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should apologise, Princess. I am not your
Highness&#8217;s adviser, nor had I any right to assume
such a position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this all you have brought me to hear, Mr.
Bergwyn?&#8221; she asked, with scarcely veiled disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I wish you to be convinced on two points&mdash;that
the army is united and must be the deciding
force in the present crisis; and that it is against your
chance of succession to the Throne. Colonel Petrosch
can speak with authority on both&mdash;if he will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On both those points I can speak absolutely,&#8221;
he replied; and very succinctly and clearly he made
good his case as to the unanimity of the great majority
of the regiments. That he succeeded in impressing
her deeply was plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;And as to myself?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I much regret to have to say the army would
not consent to serve under your Highness, or any
member of your family,&#8221; he answered, decision in
every syllable.</p>

<p>The gravity of the words appealed to us all.</p>

<p>Gatrina paused. &#8220;Any member of my family,
Colonel Petrosch?&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;That would include
His Majesty himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam, I have spoken under pressure; but my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
words stand and are not to be recalled,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;I speak not alone for myself, but for the entire
committee of officers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your words are full of dangerous insinuations.
What do you mean to imply?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can add little to what I have said. The plans
of the army have been much canvassed in the Court
and elsewhere, and much misunderstood. But they
have been decided upon; although, of course, that
decision is secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you tell me this?&#8221; she asked quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;At Mr. Bergwyn&#8217;s desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your pardon; that is a question to be put to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I got up to end the interview; and after a moment
Gatrina arose also, and with a bow to the two men
went out with me. We returned to the room where
we had been alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have kept my word. I trust you are convinced,&#8221;
I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am bewildered. I don&#8217;t know whether to take
it seriously and be gravely alarmed, or to scoff at the
whole thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you must take it very seriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it means that the officers are all but in open
revolt against the Throne, Mr. Bergwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know the many reports to the same effect,
all quite openly canvassed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How have you influenced Colonel Petrosch to
speak in this way to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be enough that he has so spoken. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
question does not touch that of your decision as to
your own action.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you counsel me to run away, then?&#8221; she
cried, indignantly and almost contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid I have no influence with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. That is true&mdash;now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you emphasise that word in particular&mdash;now?&#8221;</p>

<p>She disregarded the question, but after thinking
earnestly for a few seconds, her brows knitted and
her face intensely serious, she said: &#8220;The one
serious thing is the statement that the regiments are
now unanimous. Do you believe that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not the shadow of a doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so set upon frightening me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You asked me that last night. I told you I have
no such wish; I desire only that you shall know the
truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not leave my country, Mr. Bergwyn&mdash;even
if all this be true. Nothing shall make me do
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feared that would be your decision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hoped I should be a coward then! Thank
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not how I should describe my thoughts;
but phrases are not of much consequence where
things themselves are so grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If what this Colonel insinuates be true, the Queen
herself would be in trouble and even in danger;
would you have me desert her? Do you mean you
think that would not be the act of a coward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If your remaining to marry the Prince Albrevics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
would help her, I should say it would be cowardly to
leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>She flushed with anger. &#8220;You do Her Majesty
wrong and dishonour, Mr. Bergwyn, in saying that.
She knows now that, like the rest of us, she has
been mistaken in regard to the Prince. I have
spoken freely with her and the marriage will not
take place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very glad to hear it,&#8221; I replied in a carefully
restrained tone, hiding alike my surprise and
unbounded delight at the news. But she had not
exhausted her anger against me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like so many men you seem to find delight in
wronging one of the noblest women that ever lived&mdash;the
staunchest friend that a girl could have.&#8221; It
was an easy inference that the Queen had talked
her over, but I admired Gatrina all the more for
this chivalrous and warm defence.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it be possible I should like you to believe that
I find no pleasure at all in wronging any woman.
But I do not take the same view of the Queen as you
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have allowed yourself to be poisoned against
her. I know by whom, and, perhaps, you are not to
blame.&#8221; A reference to Elma this and an unmistakable
sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I understand your reference, and there
are several things I wish to make plainer to you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg you not to trouble, Mr. Bergwyn. I wish
to leave now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will let me explain surely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no room for any explanations. I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
enough, thank you. Let me go to the Countess
Vashti.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very unjust and very hard. Last night
after I had seen you I had a conversation with
the&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite aware of that,&#8221; she broke in, smiling
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t misunderstand me,&#8221; I cried,
earnestly. &#8220;You must let me speak of it. It
means&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Impressed by my vehemence, I think, she was going
to listen when the door of the room was thrust
open with some violence, and Prince Albrevics entered,
followed by Elma herself. The Prince was
furiously angry; his face more crimson than usual
even, and his manner truculent and threatening.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s true and you <i>are</i> here, Gatrina. What is
the meaning of it? I have come to fetch you away.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hectoring tone and the insolent ignoring of me
made me hot.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess Gatrina is here by Her Majesty&#8217;s
desire, sir,&#8221; I said, as calmly as I could.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing to say to you&mdash;yet,&#8221; he answered,
first giving me a vicious look and then ostentatiously
turning his back upon me.</p>

<p>Elma laughed, audibly enough for us all to hear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no need of your escort, Prince,&#8221; said
Gatrina. &#8220;The Countess Vashti is with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will come with me,&#8221; he retorted, curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I shall go with the Countess.
Will you take me to her, Mr. Bergwyn?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221; I went toward the door. I observed
that she had not taken the slightest notice of Elma.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have the right to escort you, Gatrina. We
don&#8217;t need the interference of any foreigners.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gatrina was in the act of leaving but at this she
stopped and turned to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are in error, Prince. You have no longer
the right which you imply. Her Majesty will explain
to you the reason. Your arm, if you please,
Mr. Bergwyn.&#8221; And taking my arm she swept past
him, her head high and looking every inch a
Princess.</p>

<p>He changed colour at her words, and glared at me
with a malignity that I expected to find utterance in
fierce words. But he held them back and just did the
cursing internally, I suppose.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess&#8217;s carriage,&#8221; I said to Buller as we
crossed the hall to the room where the Countess was
waiting.</p>

<p>Just as she came out and we stood in the hall, an
unexpected incident occurred.</p>

<p>Chris appeared from somewhere and, recognising
Gatrina, rushed to her with signs of extravagant delight.</p>

<p>She left my arm and bending over him patted him
and made much of him in her old way; and the
dog whimpered and frolicked about her, fawning on
and licking her as if he had been a young pup. In
the midst of it Elma and Prince Albrevics came out
and watched them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the meaning of that?&#8221; growled the
Prince, with a scowl.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>&#8220;One might almost think they were old friends,&#8221;
answered Elma, in her sweetest tone.</p>

<p>Gatrina paid no heed to either remark, although
she must have heard them both; and when she raised
her head I saw in her brightly shining eyes an expression
I had not seen since I came to Belgrade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down, Chris, down,&#8221; I cried, for the dog was
loath to let her go.</p>

<p>&#8220;He remembers me, Mr. Bergwyn; I should not
like him to have forgotten,&#8221; said Gatrina, very gently,
but meaningly. It was her way of answering Elma&#8217;s
sneer.</p>

<p>I accompanied them to the carriage, Chris coming
with us, and his great wistful eyes followed her all
the time until she drove away.</p>

<p>As I returned into the house, the Prince passed
me on the threshold. I stopped, meaning to have
some plain-pointed talk with him.</p>

<p>But he prevented that. &#8220;I don&#8217;t quarrel with a
man in his own house, sir, but we shall meet again,&#8221;
he said, and hurried away without giving me a chance
to reply.</p>

<small>THE INSULT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Gatrina&#8217;s visit resulted in little more than a fiasco,
owing to the interruption of Prince Albrevics. I re-entered
the house in a quite fit mood to quarrel with
Elma for having brought him upon the scene as she
had.</p>

<p>Nikolitch had come out in search of me, however,
and was speaking to her in the hall, so that I could
say nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not be long, Bergwyn?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will wait while you despatch your business with
Colonel Petrosch, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221; said Elma, readily.
&#8220;I am in no hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret I can give you no time to-day, Baroness,&#8221;
I said, bluntly intending it as her dismissal. But
she laughed it away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can come and tell me so when he has gone,&#8221;
she answered, and turned into one of the rooms, contriving
to convey a most irritating suggestion that
she was quite at home and perfectly accustomed to
humour my whims.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did she know Petrosch was here?&#8221; asked
Nikolitch. &#8220;She is a wonderful woman. She knows
everything. She will understand why he has come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her,&#8221; said I, with a shrug. &#8220;It makes no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
difference;&#8221; and with that we went back to the
Colonel.</p>

<p>The rest of the business was soon despatched. I
handed him the undertaking I had drawn up and
thus stood pledged to support the cause of the army
on the conditions I had already specified. When the
Colonel had gone Nikolitch remained, and when we
had fixed up an engagement to dine together that
night, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you have done the right thing, Bergwyn;
and there is no doubt your action will strengthen the
moderates among us. It will make against the
policy of violence; and may render it impossible. I
hope so with all my heart,&#8221; he said, earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A forced abdication. As I have told you it has
been put to the King more than once, and he has
refused obstinately. But now, backed by the united
army, it will be different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he should still refuse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have to go. The Queen has made it imperative.
For a clever woman she has made amazing
blunders. Of course you understand the Russian
partisans won&#8217;t love you any more than the
Queen will continue to be friendly to you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she gets to know what has passed.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded significantly toward the room where
Elma had gone. &#8220;She&#8217;ll see to that, probably&mdash;unless
she has some other move. If you can stop her,
I should.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no influence with her and seek none.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the story she persists in telling, my dear
fellow,&#8221; he said with a slow smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the story I tell&mdash;and it&#8217;s the true one, Nikolitch.
What story do you mean this of hers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you to-night. I&#8217;ve a lot to do now. Of
course you know your own cards; but if I were you,
I should keep in with her. She can be dangerous,
as I&#8217;ve told you more than once. Well, till this
evening then,&#8221; he added lightly, and went away.</p>

<p>What story had Elma been spreading now? I
had better know it at once, I thought, and went to
her to ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Colonel has gone, then? And the Captain,
too. I am glad you have him for a friend, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221;
she said, in her lightest manner. &#8220;You would
have found Belgrade dull without a man friend. Yet
you don&#8217;t quite understand the captain&#8217;s position?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you stay to enlighten me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, no. I have much more important matters
to discuss. But I wish I had warned you that
although he is on excellent terms with the officers&mdash;as
he is with everyone, being a delightful man&mdash;yet
he is not in the inner circle. He is of great use to
them; but he knows only what they choose to tell
him. He has been of great use to them, for instance,
in getting you over to their cause; but of course he
has led you to make a great mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has just told me that you have spread some
report concerning you and myself. What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought he would. He hinted to me just now
in the minute I had with him that he had heard something;
and naturally I did not undeceive him. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
seemed greatly mystified; of course I knew why,&#8221;
she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you will enlighten me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it is rather a delicate question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would speak plainly,&#8221; I broke out,
brusquely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it was in this way. You see you and
I were together for some considerable time last night
at the Palace; and as people had heard rumours of the
reason for your presence in Belgrade&mdash;rumours connecting
us, I mean; I suppose they put two and two
together&mdash;at least they put us together, that is to
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Nikolitch puts the origin of the rumour
down to you, Baroness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I object. American millionaires
are very rare in Belgrade, and if people chose to
think that I was engaged to one, was it likely that
I should have so little of feminine vanity as to be displeased?&#8221;</p>

<p>I understood now the reason for Gatrina&#8217;s coldness,
her marked estrangement during her visit, and the
undermeaning of some of her words. She had heard
this infernal story. Elma enjoyed my dismay; and
I believe understood the cause of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that you actually gave countenance
to such a thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray don&#8217;t look so painfully shocked, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221;
she mocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will place me in the extremely invidious
position of having to deny the report, Baroness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her laugh at this had all the ring of genuineness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
&#8220;How will you do it, Mr. Bergwyn?&#8221; she asked, in
renewed mockery of my earnestness. &#8220;Think.
How can you do it? You and I know that it has
no sort of foundation in fact; but how can we stop
the tongue of gossip? Let us be sensible and just
live it down. Other people&#8217;s names have been
coupled together in the same way in mistake before
now; but they have not been married in consequence.
Nor shall we be, I suppose. But it is a delightful
situation none the less, and just what I desired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remembered what you said last night,&#8221; I exclaimed,
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better laugh at it all than be angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no laughter to spare for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that is because of Gatrina. Naturally, too.
But it was she who made it necessary, and of course,
so far as she is concerned, the desired effect has already
been produced. In a week or two the thing
will die a natural death, as such things do; and
neither of us will be a krone the worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are the most exasperating woman
that ever lived,&#8221; I said hotly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can quite understand that thought. As I told
you last night I have to play many parts. This one
you and Gatrina together have forced upon me.&#8221; She
spoke lightly and shrugged her shoulders, but after
a moment was serious. &#8220;I told you also, last night,
that if you forced me to fight, I would do it openly.
Gatrina&#8217;s trust in you was in our way and had to be
broken somehow. It was broken when she heard
this news. The Queen had to use the utmost pressure
to induce her to come to you to-day. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
Majesty did me the honour to ask me in Gatrina&#8217;s
presence whether there was any truth in the report
of my secret engagement to you&mdash;it is supposed to be
no more than secret&mdash;and I could not, at least I did
not, deny it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is infamous,&#8221; I broke in, passionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Infamous if you like, but necessary. You have
seen Gatrina for the last time, Mr. Bergwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go to the Queen herself and deny it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might, if she would receive you. But
Gatrina was supposed to be coming as a last step to
win you and your money to the side of the Court.
Can she carry back any news other than that her
mission as Queen&#8217;s Advocate has failed? You are
now, indeed, pledged to support the cause of Her
Majesty&#8217;s bitterest enemies&mdash;the army. And even
angry as you are now, you can judge the prospect of
your reception. You have chosen your side and
must take the bitter with the sweet.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dwelt on all this with telling deliberateness,
and the pitiless logic of every measured word told
upon me. But the effect was not what she had intended.
Instead of growing more angry, I began
to regain coolness. The perception of difficulties has
always a steadying result with me, and I put aside
my anger at once. It was too dangerous a luxury
at such a juncture.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are building your theory upon the assumption
that I have thrown in my lot with Colonel
Petrosch and his friends. Do so by all means if it
pleases you,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I judge by what I have found here: but I shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
know for certain within a few hours. I do not act
in the dark. But if you have not, it will make no
difference in regard to the Queen&#8217;s Advocate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer not to discuss the Princess with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find someone else who will wish to do
so. Prince Albrevics attributes the failure of his
marriage to you and will force a quarrel upon you.
Rumours of that Bosnian adventure have reached
him. I wish to warn you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you anything more to say?&#8221; I asked as I
rose. &#8220;If you have, it will be well to say it at once,
as you will have no opportunity in the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I have made you feel like that, and
that you won&#8217;t believe I am sorry. You have driven
me so hard. Yet I&mdash;&#8221; She paused, looked down,
and then rising came toward me and said half wistfully,
half defiantly: &#8220;I need not be your enemy, and
would much rather be your friend. Why won&#8217;t you
see this? All the influence I have could be yours
if you would only let it be so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer to trust to myself and take my own
course, thank you,&#8221; I said, coldly.</p>

<p>She sighed wearily. &#8220;I suppose we all have our
hours of weakness and perhaps this is mine. I am
not ashamed for you to see it. Let me be your
friend, Chase. I&mdash;I won&#8217;t ask for anything else.
But I feel such a coward now for all that I have had
to do against you. I could help you in all&mdash;all except
Gatrina. That can never be possible for you.
But you are being so shamefully betrayed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have given you my answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, and I know how dogged you are.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
But if you trust these officers, this Colonel Petrosch,
he will only deceive you. I told you before, that
their policy is to be summed up in one word&mdash;assassination;
if once they resolve to move. We all know
that and dread it for the sake of Servia. And if you
help them with money, they will take it and only lie
to you. Everyone lies here. It is the common coin
of negotiation. Trust me a little, just a little, for
the sake of old times, and I&#8217;ll be true to you. I
swear on my soul I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not need your help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not acting or lying now. Trust me and I
will give up all this Russian spying business and
never touch it again. I want to feel I am working
for you, not against you. My God, I will do anything,
anything, if you will but let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have already had too clear a proof of that to
wish for any more. Your carriage is waiting,
Baroness.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gazed at me intently; and gradually her features
and the expression of her eyes hardened.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you will&mdash;but that decision will cost you
dear. The men whom you have helped or are going
to help with your money are assassins; and when
they have done their work and when the city runs
red with blood, and both the Queen and her advocate,
Gatrina, lie dead among their victims, you will
remember this hour and your rejection of my help;
and eat out your heart in belated, unavailing regret.
Do you still persist in sending me away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your carriage is waiting,&#8221; I repeated doggedly;
and she went without another word.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>I returned to my library feeling very much disturbed.
I was cooking a dish that didn&#8217;t promise to
be easy of digestion. I could see that, without the
help of Nikolitch&#8217;s words and Elma&#8217;s dramatic confirmation
of them. What she had said about assassination
had impressed me more than I cared to own;
and I recalled Nikolitch&#8217;s uneasy hope on that score.
Two people more unlike than he and Elma it would
be difficult to find; and yet both appeared to hold
much the same opinion.</p>

<p>Then there was this reported engagement to Elma
and all the string of complications arising out of it.
There was only too much reason to believe that it
had served its end, as she had said, in regard to
Gatrina. It was like a net about my feet, entangling
and hampering me; and how to cut myself free from
it was more than I could see.</p>

<p>I had given my word to Gatrina on the previous
night that my coming to Belgrade had had nothing
to do with Elma; and if I had but known of the report
that morning I could have denied it to her. I
could have gnashed my teeth as I recalled her phrase
about &#8220;other things&#8221; she had heard from Elma at
the Court. I could see now what she had meant;
and it was just the opening I could have used, had
I but known; perhaps given me for the very purpose.
I had let it pass in ignorance; but I could
readily understand how she would interpret my
silence.</p>

<p>To contradict it all now was infinitely difficult. I
couldn&#8217;t walk about the streets shouting it out to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
crowd. The door of the Palace was closed to me;
and probably that of Gatrina&#8217;s house as well.</p>

<p>But her visit by the Queen&#8217;s desire, as she had so
coldly said, gave me the right to return it, and I
did so that afternoon. Without result, however.
The Princess was at the Palace, I was informed.</p>

<p>After a moment&#8217;s thought I resolved to go there;
but I did no good by that. After waiting some time
a message was brought me that Her Majesty regretted
she could not receive me just then. I asked
for Gatrina next, only to be again refused; and I
returned home in a bad temper in consequence.</p>

<p>I had not recovered it when the time came for my
appointment with Nikolitch for dinner; and he saw
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look worried,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll pass off,&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;No bad news from the States, I hope? Not another
financial crisis. They flourish over there gaily,
don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Men make fools of themselves there as elsewhere;
and with us it takes that form pretty often.
By the way, you were going to tell me some news
about the Baroness von Tulken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say you&#8217;re engaged to be married to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who says it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I rather fancy she does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t true. That&#8217;s all there is to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what the other side say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are the other side; and why the devil do
people want to gossip and chatter about me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>&#8220;My dear fellow, the place is full of gossip about
you. I don&#8217;t know whether you care to hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t amount to anything what they say&mdash;at
least to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it doesn&#8217;t. But when a man&#8217;s as rich
as you are, they will talk. Have you heard that
story about your dog?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dog? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That big brute of yours, Chris. They say he
saved the Princess Gatrina&#8217;s life in the Bosnian hills
or somewhere; and that you were in it too. Of
course I laughed at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally. So should I,&#8221; I said; but I was in
no laughing mood. &#8220;How do you suppose such a
tale got going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone with a grudge against the Princess
started it. You know what spiteful devils there are
hanging about the Court?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose there are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather. Peck each other&#8217;s eyes out if they
could. But this was a blackguard tale intended to
compromise her with you. Of course there was a lot
of talk about that carrying-off affair. Some wanted
to make out she bolted from Albrevics. Shouldn&#8217;t
blame her. He&#8217;s a beast. Hullo, there he is; and
not so drunk as usual at this hour either. I should
be careful of him, Bergwyn. He was abusing you
to-day to a friend of mine. He&#8217;s seen us, I think,
and is coming this way. Hang the fellow, what does
he want to sit at the next table to us for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Not wishing a dispute in so public a place, I was
careful not to look around as the Prince and a couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
of friends took their places at the table next to us
and began to laugh and jest loudly.</p>

<p>Nikolitch nodded to the Prince&#8217;s companions
and we went on with our dinner, the talk drifting to
our old experiences in the years when we had first
known each other.</p>

<p>The Prince, as we could not fail to see, was drinking
heavily, and I could tell from Nikolitch&#8217;s face
that like myself he was beginning to expect trouble.
Once or twice the man was ill-bred enough to
whisper to his companions while pointing at me;
and then all three would burst into laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should we have our coffee inside?&#8221; said Nikolitch
at length&mdash;we were dining in the open.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if you like;&#8221; said I, and we both rose. As
I did so I touched, quite unintentionally, the chair
of the Prince. He had his wine-glass in his hand,
and while pretending to move out of my way, he
deliberately spilt the wine all over me.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the devil with your clumsiness,&#8221; he cried,
angrily, as he jumped to his feet; &#8220;making me waste
good liquor in that way. Oh, it&#8217;s the Yankee money-man,
is it?&#8221; he added, with an oath and a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I touched your chair quite accidentally and too
slightly to have caused you to spill your wine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lie. You did it on purpose,&#8221; he cried,
loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Prince Albrevics!&#8221; exclaimed Nikolitch; while
the two men with him got up looking very serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t allow anyone to say that to me, sir,&#8221; I
said, keeping quite cool. &#8220;I must ask you to take
that word back right here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>&#8220;Not for any cowardly Yankee that was ever
born.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you will do it when you are sober then,&#8221;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m cursed if I&#8217;ll let a Yankee pig say I&#8217;m
drunk;&#8221; and he rushed forward to strike me. I
pushed him back; but this only infuriated him and
he sprang at me again.</p>

<p>I had taken more than enough from him, however,
and as he reached me the second time, his hand raised
for a blow, I got mine in first and knocked him down.</p>

<p>The place was instantly in an uproar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay and do what&#8217;s necessary, Nikolitch. I&#8217;m in
your hands. I&#8217;m going to smoke over there,&#8221; I said,
pointing to a table at a distance. And taking out
my cigar-case I walked away as the Prince&#8217;s friends
were picking him up.</p>

<small>THE DUEL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>I must have hit the Prince hard, judging by the
effects. His friends picked him up and after a
minute or so led him away into the hotel. Then
Nikolitch came across to me, his look very troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is an ugly business, Bergwyn. He&#8217;s badly
marked and half dazed with your blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am more sorry for it than I can say,&#8221; I replied.
I regretted it intensely indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was his fault&mdash;his only. We all saw that. He
came to the place with the intention of quarrelling.
He knew we were to dine here. One of his companions
heard it from a friend of mine. He behaved
abominably. We all see that: even his friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, the insult was deliberate. I couldn&#8217;t
take that. What is to happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said that we would go to your house: and
should be there, if they had a message to bring. Shall
we go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means a meeting, of course,&#8221; I said, as we left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Have you been out before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; we don&#8217;t settle our quarrels this way in the
States; but I&#8217;ve been in more than one ugly scrap
and come through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an old hand at it and is an excellent swordsman.
But you will have choice of weapons. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
beat him, through being so cool. He generally gets
the choice of weapons, taking care to give the insult
and so be the challenged party. That was his move
just now. He first insulted you, thinking you would
challenge him; and when you didn&#8217;t, he meant to
strike you so that you&#8217;d be obliged. I was glad you
prevented that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d give a good deal to be out of it,&#8221; I said, after
a pause. My companion glanced at me in some surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you can avoid it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid. I don&#8217;t mean that. But coming
right on top of what you were saying about the
Princess, it will set tongues wagging about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean the dog story?&#8221; I nodded. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s anything in that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one woman who knows it all and by this
time has the proofs. The Baroness von Tulken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the devil with that woman. She&#8217;s in everything,&#8221;
he exclaimed. &#8220;Of course that&#8217;s where it
comes from: and of course she told Albrevics. It&#8217;s
an ugly story for him to hear. You&#8217;ll have to be
careful. He means mischief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but he&#8217;s been thinking about you, Bergwyn.
What will you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil can I do, man? If it would help
things for her, I&#8217;d choose pistols and kill him; but it
would only make matters worse for her. Everyone
will set the quarrel down to her; and that&#8217;s just what
I&#8217;d have given anything to avoid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it wouldn&#8217;t hurt her. It doesn&#8217;t hurt a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
woman here for two men to quarrel about her&mdash;choosing,
of course, a decent pretext&mdash;and for one
of &#8217;em to be killed. It&#8217;s happened often enough.&#8221;
His indifferent tone no less than his words astonished
me. &#8220;Are you a good shot?&#8221; he added after a
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can shoot a bit, and use a sword well enough to
keep myself out of danger, probably, if it comes to
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will come to one or the other, Bergwyn.
There&#8217;s no other way now. Have you any foils
here?&#8221; he asked as we reached my house; and when
I produced them he proposed that we should try a
bout.</p>

<p>We took off our coats and set to work at once.
Mine was a very indifferent style, very rough and
ready, and his particularly polished, acquired in the
latest Italian school. But mine served me well
enough for defensive purposes. He was the better
swordsman, with a dozen more tricks of fence than I
possessed, but he could not break through my guard.
He touched me more than once; but not so as to
have inflicted any serious wound, had the weapons
been sharp.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t much to fear from the Prince,&#8221; he
said in one of the breathing spaces. &#8220;His is also
the Italian style; and he&#8217;s better than I am; but you
have a devil of a defence. Can you force the fighting
a bit? Try now.&#8221;</p>

<p>We crossed again and this time, after a long, defensive
play I changed my tactics suddenly, and
touched him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>&#8220;You got me in the arm,&#8221; he cried, directly.
&#8220;And well done, too. You&#8217;ll wear the Prince down.
That&#8217;s his one failing&mdash;he can&#8217;t keep his temper. I
have no fear for to-morrow. You have an iron
wrist.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were thus engaged when Buller brought word
that the friends of Prince Albrevics had arrived.
Nikolitch put on his coat and went to them. He was
in high spirits.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the challenge, of course,&#8221; he said when he
returned. &#8220;Shall we make it swords or pistols? I
have arranged to meet to-morrow morning a mile or
two out of the city. If you don&#8217;t want to kill him I
should choose swords.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it be swords then,&#8221; I agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got a devil of a bruise on his face, they tell
me,&#8221; he declared with obvious glee, as he left me
again. &#8220;As if a horse had kicked him, one of them
says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve arranged it all,&#8221; he reported when he
came back again. &#8220;They were surprised at your
choosing swords, because of his reputation, but it
will be all right. You&#8217;ll wear him down. I know
him. And now I&#8217;ll be off and find someone to act
with me. Get to bed early and have as much sleep
as you can. I&#8217;ll be round in time in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat for some time after he had left me, smoking
and thinking. I regretted the whole thing more
than I can say; but when I found my thoughts getting
into a very gloomy vein, I put the brake on; and
taking Nikolitch&#8217;s advice, went off to bed and slept
soundly until Buller called me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>Nikolitch came in good time bringing a friend, a
Captain Astic, and we drove off. It was a gloriously
fine morning, the air cool, refreshing and brisk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too much sun,&#8221; was Nikolitch&#8217;s practical comment.
He looked at everything as if it affected the
matter in hand, and spoke of it as though it were the
most ordinary course in the world that two sane
men should go out to do murder if possible.</p>

<p>Of my own sensations I need not say much. I
was thoughtful, preoccupied indeed, and gloomy. I
don&#8217;t think I was afraid; although the deliberateness
of the preparations and the anticipation of having to
meet a man in cold blood and fight him for my life,
made the affair appear almost formidable. I was far
from having a wish to do the Prince any injury, to
say nothing of taking his life; and my chief thought
was the impossible wish that the whole matter,
quarrel and all, could have been wiped out of the
record of things done and be deemed never to have
occurred.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I spoke during the drive out; but I
remember taking notice of many trifles. There was
a loose button in the upholstering of the carriage:
some stains on Captain Astic&#8217;s uniform caught my
eye, and I contrasted it with the smart grooming of
Nikolitch. My friend was awkward in handling the
pair of swords we had with us; and he and the other
joked about it. Trifles of that kind struck me; and
when the drive came to an end and we left the carriage,
I can recall my distinct sensation of relief, followed
by a fidgetty impatience to get the affair over.</p>

<p>I was irritated because the other side kept us waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
a considerable time. My seconds lit cigarettes
and first picked out the best spot for the encounter;
then in low tones discussed the delay and the probable
reasons for it; whether the Prince was too ill to
come; how long we need wait for him; and so on.
They appeared to me to speak with a certain amount
of disappointment, as one might regret being robbed
of a promised entertainment.</p>

<p>The air began to chill them and they stamped
about and clapped their gloved hands to keep the
blood circulating. But I felt nothing of that. I sat
quite still on the trunk of a fallen tree and was conscious
mainly of a sort of impressive awe making
everything seem unreal, mingled with a growing
desire that the fight could be avoided; or rather the
necessity for it obliterated&mdash;for I was perfectly
aware of its inevitability.</p>

<p>I could not bring myself to wish to harm the man
I was to meet. Once or twice I sought to rouse my
anger against him by recalling the insult of the previous
evening and the foulness of his words and conduct.
But even while I appreciated its wantonness
and inexcusable grossness, I could not stir myself
to any real passion. My sense of regret for the whole
business overshadowed everything.</p>

<p>I believe my companions thought I was suffering
from fear; but it was not conscious fear, if fear at all.
I did not anticipate any serious results to myself
from the duel. Such a thought never occurred to
me: it was the lethargy of an overwhelming revolt
from the affair as a whole.</p>

<p>It began to grow less absorbing when I heard Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
Astic tell Nikolitch, in a tone of unmistakable
relief and satisfaction, that the others were coming.</p>

<p>Nikolitch came and told me, and I noticed a solicitude
and anxiety in his tone and look that were new.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; I said, with half a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have nothing to fear,&#8221; he whispered, that
Astic might not hear him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do fear nothing, Nikolitch,&#8221; I said, with a
smile; and his face brightened at the smile.</p>

<p>As soon as they came the four seconds busied
themselves in settling the preliminaries and then
Nikolitch introduced a fifth man to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor Astic, the Captain&#8217;s brother, Bergwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>We shook hands and the doctor had a steady look
into my eyes. &#8220;It&#8217;s a chilly morning although so
bright&mdash;but we get them here sometimes,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Any morning&#8217;s good enough for this sort of
thing,&#8221; I answered; and he had another stare at me
and then put down his case of instruments on the
tree where I had been sitting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you get ready, Mr. Bergwyn?&#8221; asked Captain
Astic.</p>

<p>I saw the Prince already had his coat off and I
made ready, the Captain meanwhile pointing out the
positions we were to take with cheerful but professional
coolness.</p>

<p>As they placed us, I saw the mark of my blow on
the Prince&#8217;s face and I noticed also that he was none
too steady on his feet. I called Nikolitch to me and
pointed this out.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s his affair,&#8221; he answered with a shrug of the
shoulders.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t fight a sick man,&#8221; I said, sharply. &#8220;Speak
to the doctor about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s so irregular,&#8221; he objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;I insist,&#8221; I declared.</p>

<p>He spoke to Astic and then to the Prince&#8217;s seconds
and after some discussion, in which all four took part,
they called the doctor up to them. Then his seconds
spoke to the Prince and some angry words passed;
and again the four seconds consulted. Then Nikolitch
came to me looking angry and crestfallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry; but they think you&#8217;re afraid, Bergwyn,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a red cent what they think. Does
the doctor say the Prince is fit to fight? He can
hardly stand; look at him lurching there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Astic says he&#8217;s all right: and he knows him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he takes the responsibility. I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s only in a devil of a rage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then. I&#8217;m ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>A minute later the word was given and we engaged.
I had no lethargy left now. The last vestige
of it vanished when I felt his blade pressing mine
and met his scowl of positively devilish hate. I
needed no more than a glance into his eyes to see
that he had come out to kill me, and that my life depended
upon my skill and coolness.</p>

<p>But he was either too ill or too angry to be really
dangerous. He attacked me furiously from the
start; but he fought so wildly that I found myself
quite able to hold him in check, and I let him exert
himself to the utmost with the sure knowledge that
in such a state he could not keep it up long.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>I think he had reckoned upon being able to treat
me with the same contempt as a swordsman as he
had treated me as a man the night before; and when
he found out his mistake, it provoked his rage until
he fought with the frenzy of a madman.</p>

<p>Had he been himself and not so furiously reckless,
I think he would have had an easy enough victory,
for he had a hundred tricks of fence where I had
none.</p>

<p>He seemed to realise something of this, too, when
we had been hard at it for some time, for he began to
fight with less vehemence and much more wariness.</p>

<p>But he had wasted his strength by that time; and
to waste it still further, I commenced to push matters
a bit from my side. He began to breathe hard.
The pressure of his blade against mine weakened.
Twice his foot slipped and he exposed himself dangerously;
and then I knew I was going to beat him.</p>

<p>I took no advantage of his slips. The man was
ill, or drunk, or suffering from the effects of drink;
and I could not bring myself even to wound him.</p>

<p>I just kept to my tactics of wearing him down,
defending myself when he attacked me and pressing
him whenever he sought to ease off to get his breath
back.</p>

<p>At last it became little more than a burlesque. He
was so winded and exhausted and so unsteady on his
legs that he could scarcely continue the fight, scarcely
hold his sword, indeed; and when I realised this I
made a big, pressing effort, and seizing my moment,
whipped his sword out of his hand and left him gasping
impotently in dismay and breathlessness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
lurching like a discomfited, angry fool, until he began
to clamour to renew the fight.</p>

<p>The seconds interfered at this, however; even his
own men protesting. I stood while they settled it;
and then turned away to dress.</p>

<p>Nikolitch was loud in praises of me as I put on my
coat, but regretted I had not wounded him; as he
might want to have another meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t meet him again. It&#8217;s an additional
insult that he should have come out in such a state.
And you&#8217;d better let him know I shan&#8217;t meet him
again. If he monkeys with me again I&#8217;ll settle it in
a more American fashion; and if there&#8217;s to be another
fight of the kind, it shall begin where this morning&#8217;s
has ended.&#8221;</p>

<p>To my astonishment Nikolitch carried the message
to one of the Prince&#8217;s seconds and then we left the
ground and drove back to the city.</p>

<p>I kept Nikolitch and Captain Astic to breakfast,
and they could speak of nothing but the fight; criticising
it with almost as much fond enthusiasm as if
they had been experts describing a good game of
baseball.</p>

<p>I was glad when they left me, indeed, and I could
settle down to a quiet review of the situation. Nikolitch
was to see me again in the afternoon; and he
declared joyously and with a certain air of rather
self-congratulatory importance, that they would both
have a busy time in seeing that a true account of the
duel was spread about.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a fortunate man, Mr. Bergwyn, and will
be a popular one,&#8221; said Captain Astic. &#8220;The Prince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
is thoroughly well hated and people will be ready to
make much of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not regard it at all in that light. It was
Gatrina&#8217;s good-will, not that of the crowd, which I
sought; and I felt she would hear with strong prejudice
that I had allowed myself to be drawn into a
quarrel which she would know well enough could
only have arisen on her account.</p>

<p>Estranged as she already was by this monstrous
story of my secret understanding with Elma, she
would be quite incapable of appreciating my motives
or feelings; and the fact that I could not get to her
to explain everything irritated me almost beyond
endurance.</p>

<p>It was my helplessness in that direction which tried
me more than anything. She had set up a barrier
between us which I could not break through. There
was nothing I could do but fret and fume and pace
up and down the room and down and up again, in
vain imaginings as to how things were to end.</p>

<p>To an active temperament like mine nothing could
be more galling. Prompt decision and action were
mental instincts with me. I was accustomed in all
affairs of life to take hold of a thing, plan my course
and follow it up quickly and energetically. And yet
here I had somehow allowed the reins to be snatched
from my grasp and could only wring my hands in
fatuous futility while I was being carried I could not
tell where.</p>

<p>Do something I must; so I made another effort to
see Gatrina, and pushed it until I met with a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
ugly rebuff. I was told she was out, and I declared
I would wait until she returned.</p>

<p>I waited, and waited, and waited until my patience
was exhausted, only to be told by her servants that
while I had been waiting she had returned and gone
out again without seeing me.</p>

<p>I went home and wrote to her that I must see her
on a matter of the most urgent importance. I gave
the letter to Buller with instructions to place it personally
in Gatrina&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>An hour and more passed, and when he came he
brought a reply in her handwriting. I tore the
envelope open and my own letter, unopened, was
enclosed and with it a cutting from a paper of that
morning&#8217;s date, announcing in guarded terms my
engagement to Elma.</p>

<p>At first I flushed with mortification and resentment,
but then caught a glimpse of light.</p>

<p>If it was really the lie about Elma which had
estranged her, I had but to get the truth to her to
change that anger and make her feel the injustice she
had done me.</p>

<p>I cast about for the means. She would neither
see me nor read my letters; so that I must find someone
who could get access to her.</p>

<p>I thought instantly of Karasch. I would send him
to her and let Chris go with him as a mute ambassador.
This might touch her for the sake of the
past; and Karasch&#8217;s message should be just one sentence&mdash;that
the announcement in the paper was a
lie.</p>

<p>I sent for him at once, instructed him how to act,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
and despatched him on the errand; only to be defeated
again, however. Gatrina had refused to see
him.</p>

<p>There was only Nikolitch left, and even he failed
me. He did not come at the time he had appointed,
and when I went to his rooms in search of him, I
heard that he had been sent away on military business
and would not return until night or the next
morning.</p>

<p>So the whole day passed without anything being
done to kill the lie which was having such ominous
results for me.</p>

<p>It was noon on the next day when I saw Nikolitch;
and very anxious and disturbed he looked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have grave news for you, Bergwyn,&#8221; he said
at once. &#8220;The officers are going to move at once
and a day or two, perhaps an hour or two, will find
the crisis here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to see you about something else,&#8221; I said,
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;My news first,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Before anything
else, you must know it. I fear that that condition
of no violence will not be kept.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly my thoughts were for Gatrina and I
chilled with fear for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak plainly, Nikolitch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come back at some risk to do so. I have
only the worst to report. We moderates have been
outvoted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like a flash Elma&#8217;s grim word, &#8220;Assassination&#8221;
darted across my mind as I waited for him to continue.</p>

<small>THE SCENT OF PERIL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I got a scent of the trouble yesterday,&#8221; said
Nikolitch after a pause, long enough to try my
patience severely; &#8220;and should have come to you
at once, but I was sent out of the city to Jagodina
with part of the regiment. I dared not write to you
for fear the letter got into wrong hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you hear, and how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know there have been many changes made
in the regiments here; and no one could understand
the reason for them. But I believe I know it now.
Those officers who are against force have been gradually
sent out of the city and their places filled by
men of the opposite views. Yesterday an excuse
was made that some man&#339;uvres were to be held
round Jagodina; and by means of it nearly all of the
no-violence men were sent away&mdash;myself amongst
them; while others have been moved in. You can
guess the object&mdash;a <i>coup d&#8217;etat</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Petrosch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was like a sphinx when I managed to see him
yesterday. Denied the idea of force, referred to the
arrangement with you; but would say not a word as
to what was intended. He pleaded entire ignorance.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>&#8220;What will happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot say. We discussed it all last night at
Jagodina, and the impression there is that some most
drastic steps have been decided secretly and that we
were being got out of the way for them to be carried
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of violence do you anticipate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows,&#8221; he exclaimed, throwing up his
hands, almost despairingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must see Petrosch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not. I am supposed to be in Jagodina.
I got leave of absence because the chief is very
friendly, but he said I must not come to Belgrade.
He meant I mustn&#8217;t let him know if I did. So I said
I wished to go to Alexinatz. But I felt I must get
the news to you somehow; so I came here secretly.
I shall be broken if my presence is known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you stay and see it through, now you are
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I owe you no less, Bergwyn, let happen what
will. I have got you into it. But I should prefer
not to go outside this house if we can help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted you to do me a great service. And it
is more important now than ever, if what you think
is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To go to the Princess Gatrina.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have thought of her. That&#8217;s largely why I
came&mdash;after what you told me about the hill business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think she would be in danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can it be otherwise? But of course it depends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
on what is going to happen. You must warn
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it. I can&#8217;t get a word to her. I was
trying all yesterday. She won&#8217;t see me, wouldn&#8217;t
read a letter I sent asking her to see me; wouldn&#8217;t
even let the man who helped us in the hill affair have
a word with her. I hoped you would be able to help
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment. &#8220;Of course I will,&#8221; he
said then. &#8220;The thing&#8217;s too grave to let any personal
considerations weigh with me. She must be
persuaded to leave the city&mdash;at least until the officers
have carried out their plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She must, or the worst may happen to her. Some
of these men will go to any extreme.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it plainer, Nikolitch. You mean her life
will be in danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like even to think of it in plain terms,
Bergwyn. To tell you the truth, I believe I&#8217;m horribly
afraid and can&#8217;t think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go to Petrosch myself at once, while you go
to the Princess. I think she will receive you. What
I want you particularly to do with her is persuade her
that there is no foundation for this statement;&#8221; and I
put the newspaper cutting in his hand.</p>

<p>He read it and looked up. &#8220;Is it a time to think
of this?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; because when that is contradicted she may
consent to see me and I can add my influence to persuade
her to seek safety in flight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would they let her go?&#8221; he asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>&#8220;Get her consent and I&#8217;ll do the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send your man to my rooms for clothes. I
mustn&#8217;t be seen in these;&#8221; and he shewed me that
under a long overcoat he was wearing his uniform.</p>

<p>I rang for Buller and gave him instructions, and
then started to find Colonel Petrosch. I had much
difficulty, driving from place to place and losing
much time, to catch him after all at his house.</p>

<p>Having heard of my first call he was thus prepared
for my visit; and must have guessed my object, although
he expressed surprise at seeing me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to see you very particularly, Colonel; you
will have heard that I called here a couple of hours
ago; and I have been seeking you ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry; but of course if you had sent
me word beforehand I would have waited in or come
to you, Mr. Bergwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not do that. I have only just heard the
news which has brought me to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed. How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have many sources, as you will understand. Is
it true that the officers have resolved upon their line
of action?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I told you that two days ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you then I could not disclose it, Mr. Bergwyn.
You will remember that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has there been any alteration in their plans?&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. &#8220;In a sense, no. No finally decisive
step taken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There have been some considerable changes in
the disposition of the regiments?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>&#8220;Oh, yes. We have had some man&#339;uvres at
Jagodina and have had to make them as imposing as
possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the only reason for the changes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not entirely. Some have been made in connection
with the plan of the officers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A large number of officers have been brought to
the capital. I know that. Are these the men who
favour a policy of force?&#8221;</p>

<p>He flinched from the question. &#8220;Is that your information?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; just that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To a certain extent you are right, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221;
he answered slowly. &#8220;I had better tell you
something. Since I saw you, a formal demand has
been made to the King to abdicate, backed by the
statement &#8216;that a refusal would be followed by the
declaration of the army against him.&#8217; At first he refused;
but afterwards withdrew the peremptory
refusal and asked for time to consider the matter.
A week was conceded and there the matter was left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then nothing will be done for a week?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing <i>would</i> have been done; but His Majesty
or the Government, most probably the Queen, has
broken faith. Of those who waited upon him&mdash;there
were five&mdash;three have been arrested and
thrown into prison. Naturally the army is embittered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;For whatever happens
now, the blame will lie with the Court.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s about as hopeless news as you
could give me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>&#8220;It is not good,&#8221; he replied, very gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are still in a position to keep the condition
of no violence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have decided to release you from your
undertaking so that we may not even appear to be
guilty of bad faith. The decision has just been
made; and I should have written you at once or seen
you, to return you this paper;&#8221; and he put my letter
back into my hands.</p>

<p>Nothing that he could have said or done would
have so deeply impressed me as that.</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me there had been no change of plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been none&mdash;yet,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;The
final decision has still to be made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard your policy summed up in the one
word&mdash;assassination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our policy has always been liable to misinterpretation;
against that, in times like these, we cannot
guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t disguise from you that you have alarmed
me greatly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there a man in the country at the present time
who does not view the future with alarm? The issues
are too fateful for all classes, Mr. Bergwyn. But if
you are speaking in contemplation of any sort of
financial business, I would advise you strongly to
hold your hand and wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Until the new Government is established, the
new King crowned and the country once more
settled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The new King?&#8221; I asked quickly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>&#8220;The succession will revert to the Karageorgevics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Princess Gatrina?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very unfortunate for her and her friends
that she still remains in the city.&#8221; He spoke with
impressive deliberation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is largely on her account I have been influenced
in what I have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have gathered for myself, Mr. Bergwyn;
and so I have thought, despite the contradictory
rumours which have reached me concerning you
both&mdash;and others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you give me no assurance that at least she
will be in no personal danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused a long time to think. &#8220;Personally I
will do everything in my power. You have met me
so frankly that you deserve no less. You may rely
upon me to do my utmost; but although I shall of
course have considerable influence, I am but one of
many.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would be allowed to leave the city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her departure would be welcome if she would
go at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if she stays?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She may carry her life in her hands, Mr. Bergwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I could still depend upon your influence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the uttermost shred. I give you my honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>I rose to go then. &#8220;I need not assure you that I
shall treat in confidence what you have said, Colonel
Petrosch.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>He shook his head. &#8220;It does not matter now, Mr.
Bergwyn. I have told you nothing&mdash;I could tell
you nothing, of course&mdash;that may not be openly repeated.
It is too late for anything of that kind to
signify now. The army is too strong to be shaken
from its purpose by anything that could happen.
You will see that yourself very soon. The die is
cast.&#8221;</p>

<p>This indifference to publicity amazed me as much
as anything he had said in the interview and confirmed
the absorbingly gloomy impression which he
had created.</p>

<p>I drove back to my house feverishly anxious now
to hear how Nikolitch had fared with Gatrina. But
he had not returned and I sat eating out my heart
with impatience at his delay. He was so long that
I began to fear he might have been arrested for having
come to the city in defiance of his orders, and I
sent Buller at length to the Princess&#8217;s house for news
of him.</p>

<p>A line came back from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is away. I am waiting for her return.&#8221;</p>

<p>I scribbled a reply to this.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had the worst confirmed. For God&#8217;s
sake do all you can;&#8221; and this I sent back to him by
Buller.</p>

<p>The suspense of the time that followed was agony.
My alarm for her took a hundred crude and wild
shapes as I thought of the peril that would encircle
her when the desperate schemes of the army were
once put in operation.</p>

<p>I was maddening myself with such thoughts when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
Buller brought me Elma&#8217;s card. I sent a curt message
that I would not see her. I felt I could not
trust myself in that desperate mood.</p>

<p>But he came back with a note.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must see me. I have terrible news affecting
Gatrina&#8217;s safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went to her then. In such a cause I was ready
to go anywhere and do anything. She was more
serious than I had seen her before, and spoke without
any of the affectations customary with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be peace between us, Mr. Bergwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you come for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gatrina is in danger and you must help to save
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A revolution is imminent, and if Gatrina is in the
city when it breaks out, she will be involved. The
King has been told he must abdicate, and a conflict
between him and the army is now certain. She must
be got to a place of safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you come to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because you can prevail with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, you have made that impossible.
You know how&mdash;by the false tale you told before the
Queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can be contradicted. I will contradict it if
you agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Agree to what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To unite with us in saving her to take the
Throne.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean to marry the Duke Barinski?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, first, to save her life. This is no time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
to think of any personal ends. She is necessary to
the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has no chance of succeeding to the Throne.
I know that. I know what is to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can help us if you will. Get her to trust
herself to us instead of to the Court, and we will be
responsible for her safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How? Another case of Maglai?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not sneer. I did not mean that. She
would be safe under the protection of the Russian
flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With you as her chief adviser and friend. I
should not deem that safety; nor would she.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You abandon her then to her fate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not counsel her to play the part of cat&#8217;s
paw for Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even to save her life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you undo the mischief you have caused and
let her know the truth? Then I will act with you
to this extent. If I can, I will prevail with her to
leave the country for a time and from a position of
freedom, decide whether to make this marriage or
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She must not leave the country. She must be
here when the moment of crisis arrives, and the
future occupant of the Throne has to be chosen. Her
absence then might be fatal to everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to her and tell her that all you said was untrue
and why you said it, and leave the decision to
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are still dreaming of the impossible. I have
shewn her most of your old letters to me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>&#8220;Then you had better tell your Russian employers
how you have succeeded in wrecking their schemes.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused in considerable embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have some other aim, however,&#8221; I
continued. &#8220;You have contradicted yourself. You
said at first that I still had influence with her: now
that you have kept your word and broken her trust
in me; and yet that you need my help. You will not
be surprised that I find it difficult to believe you at
all&mdash;except as a power for mischief and wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not seem to realise her peril.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you do not explain your inconsistency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will make it all plain to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that I may go to counsel her to marry another
man. I will not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even to save her life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You said that before. I will find means to save
her life, if it should be really in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I have proposed is the only way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may think so. I will find another. I do
not trust either you or your employers. You can
help me by undoing what you have done and telling
her the truth&mdash;by that means you can aid in saving
her life. But with your help or without, I will find
the means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very bitter against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I speak the truth and the truth may well have a
bitter sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you refuse me, the responsibility for what may
occur will be yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you go to her and admit the falsehood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you agree to my terms. Not otherwise.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>&#8220;That was the answer I expected,&#8221; I said as I rose.</p>

<p>She made a gesture of impatient dissent. &#8220;You
make things so difficult. We both desire the same
end: the Princess&#8217;s safety; and yet you will not act
with me to reach it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You come to me, or you are sent to me, because
it is thought I can now be of some use as a decoy.
I have no fancy for the part. I do not trust you or
those behind you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You entirely misjudge my motives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very possibly, if they are genuine. You have
taught me not to expect that; and I have learnt the
lesson. That&#8217;s all there is to it. And now, I have
no wish to say to you any more of the angry things
I feel. Shall we end this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you consider what I have said and let me
come to-morrow for an answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. You have my answer; and I have no wish
to see you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How bitter you can be!&#8221; she cried, rising.</p>

<p>My only reply was to open the door for her to
leave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to render me desperate? You
underestimate my power to revenge myself. You
will drive me to take a course which even I might
afterwards regret. I am not yet Gatrina&#8217;s enemy;
but ...&#8221; a very angry glance finished the sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall do better to end this,&#8221; I answered,
curtly, meeting her look as I held the door for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be well advised for your own and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
sake if I find you in a different mood to-morrow;&#8221;
and with this threat she went.</p>

<p>For her threats I cared little enough; and the only
part of the interview which made any impression
was the confirmation she had brought of the coming
trouble.</p>

<p>I was thinking this round when Nikolitch returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; I asked eagerly.</p>

<p>He shook his head. &#8220;I have done no good,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>My heart fell at the words. The last chance had
failed, and I knew by my pang of disappointment
how much I had built upon my friend&#8217;s mission.</p>

<p>It was some time before I could even bring myself
to ask Nikolitch for details of his visit to Gatrina.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw the Princess?&#8221; I asked at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not come away without. She had been
at the Palace, I think. She received me graciously
at first&mdash;she does all things prettily&mdash;and listened
while I warned her that grave troubles were coming.
Then something I said suggested to her that I had
come from you; and her manner changed suddenly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would, I suppose,&#8221; I interjected, bitterly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She put the question point blank, and I admitted
it, of course. Then she refused to hear any more.
I said that you were very anxious to see her; and she
got up and was for dismissing me on the spot. But I
hung on and managed to get out the contradiction of
the engagement, as she was hurrying away. At the
door she turned, her face very pale, her manner and
tone cold as ice. &#8216;Under the circumstances, Captain
Nikolitch, your presence is an insult,&#8217; she said. And
never in my life have I felt the lash of a woman&#8217;s
tongue more keenly. I suppose she was mad you had
told me anything of how matters stood with you.
I felt like a whipped cur as I stumbled out of the
room.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s just a devil of a mess, that&#8217;s all, and
we&#8217;ll have to find some way of helping her against
her will.&#8221;</p>

<p>I told him of the result of my visit to Petrosch and
of the confirmation of the news from Elma. His
view of the outlook was even darker than my own;
and when I let drop a hint of the suggestion which
Elma had made, he was disposed to freeze to it as the
best and readiest solution of the difficulty.</p>

<p>But I shook my head. &#8220;The Princess would never
trust herself to them,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I know her too well
to think that for a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would be safe. Other things would settle
themselves afterwards. The hours of peril will be
few, whatever happens; and when they are once
passed, the itch for violence will be appeased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said again. &#8220;I say no, emphatically no.
If she believed the danger were really so acute, she
would go to the Queen and stand or fall with her.
She would regard it as cowardly to think of herself
at such a time; and nothing would induce her to set
foot inside the Russian Minister&#8217;s house merely to
save herself. It would but drive her into greater
peril that if she remained in her own. It is there
she must be protected. Would God I could but
learn when the devilment is to be done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I could learn that. Not here, of course,
where if I were recognised I should be clapped
straight away under arrest; but at Jagodina. They
will know there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then for Heaven&#8217;s sake get back to Jagodina at
once and send me word. I will do the rest. I begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>
to see a way at last&mdash;if she will but stay in her own
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. Don&#8217;t stay another minute in the city.
Get to your regiment and send me the news I want.
Just the time; that&#8217;s all; that&#8217;s all. It may not be
safe to send more;&#8221; and seizing a time table I found
there was a train he could catch at once, and I hurried
him off.</p>

<p>&#8220;My uniform,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m in mufti.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave it. It may be useful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t tell you, you can&#8217;t be compromised.
Do as I ask; that&#8217;s all. And for Heaven&#8217;s sake be
off at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>I infected him with a degree of my own energy
and bundled him off to the depot, and sent Buller with
him with instructions to get him a special train if he
missed the regular one.</p>

<p>Then I gave word that the instant Karasch arrived
he was to be shewn to me; it was close to the
hour at which he was accustomed to come for instructions;
and having done that I set to work to
think out my plan as I ate a hasty dinner.</p>

<p>The plan was a very simple one&mdash;to raise immediately
a band of men numerous enough to protect
Gatrina&#8217;s house in case of emergency, and to find
some place close to it where they could remain in
readiness under Karasch&#8217;s leadership.</p>

<p>The idea took a more daring form at one time,
and I was much tempted to adopt it. It was to have
the men in the uniform of one of the regiments and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
to act the part of guarding the house, as if at the
army&#8217;s command; but the risk which the men would
run if the thing were discovered was too great. I
might not be able to protect them even with
Petrosch&#8217;s influence; and I had, therefore, to abandon
the notion. But from it came another idea which I
saw at once was practicable.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is work for you at last, Karasch,&#8221; I said
to him as soon as he arrived; &#8220;difficult, and perhaps
dangerous; and I am going to trust to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do my best, Excellency, whatever it be,&#8221; he
answered, with his customary directness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugly things are going to occur in the city; a
revolution accompanied probably with violence is
on the eve of taking place; and no one can say for
certain what will or will not happen. But it is very
probable that the Princess&mdash;Mademoiselle, you know&mdash;will
be exposed to great danger, and I wish you
to help me in protecting her. You will do this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With my life, Excellency. Of course you have
a plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I mean you to get together a strong band
of resolute men to be instantly available to form
a guard round her house. They must be men on
whom we can depend; and we will pay them liberally.
How many can you get?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could get a thousand to take your money and
promise; and I might find fifty or less who might
keep their promises; and, perhaps, five or six who
would be absolutely reliable. It would depend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On whom Mademoiselle had to be defended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>
against. If against the mob it would be easy, but
not against soldiers, Excellency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will probably be against the soldiery.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head doubtingly. &#8220;It would be
very difficult,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has to be done, Karasch,&#8221; I declared firmly.
&#8220;The Princess&#8217;s life may depend upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where twenty men would face the sticks and
stones of a mob, scarce one of them would stand
before the bayonets or bullets of the troops, Excellency.
Should we be inside the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he exclaimed with another very grave shake
of the head.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> would do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am different; but I would not do it for money.
I have been in similar troubles before; and for those
who resist the soldiers at such times, there are many
roads to death and all short and pretty certain. Men
know this, Excellency. Belgrade is not like the hills
in the Gravenje district. I might count on five or
six, as I say; but what are they against the troops
in the city?&#8221;</p>

<p>I thought a moment. &#8220;Could you trust them
absolutely?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; as you may trust me. But, I beg your
Excellency&#8217;s pardon, why cannot the Princess remove
to a place of safety?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will not, for reasons I cannot explain to
you. For one thing she does not know of her danger,
and will not believe in it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>&#8220;Mademoiselle has a strong will, we know,&#8221; he
said, with a shrug of his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has, therefore, to be saved despite herself.
Stay, I have it,&#8221; I exclaimed as a thought struck me.
&#8220;You say these five or six men are to be relied upon.
Could you procure half a dozen uniforms for them to
wear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could get half a hundred, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my plan then. Get the other men, fifty
or a hundred of them&mdash;as many as you can&mdash;to be
available if the only trouble comes from the mob.
The six we will make up as soldiers, and at the worst
we will force our way with them into the house and
bring off the Princess as though she were our
prisoner.&#8221;</p>

<p>He chewed the notion for a moment and then his
grim face relaxed into one of his rare smiles. &#8220;It
is good,&#8221; he said; and we set to work and threshed
out the plan in as much detail as practicable at that
stage.</p>

<p>I decided that the half dozen men who with
Karasch and myself were to take the risk of making
the pretended arrest of Gatrina, should wear the
uniform of soldiers and over that loose civilian&#8217;s
clothes which could be easily slipped off in case of
need. The men would in this way be available for
both parts of the work before us; as civilians to resist
the mob, or as soldiers to mislead the regular troops.</p>

<p>I based my plans on the calculation that in making
any attempt on Gatrina&#8217;s house the troops were not
likely to be in any considerable force. The movement
would be more in the nature of an arrest; and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
we could manage to get into the house before the
soldiers sent to make the arrest, they would be likely
to conclude, if they saw Gatrina in our hands, that in
the confusion some mistake had been made in doubling
the parties told off for the purpose.</p>

<p>I should be in command and should wear the uniform
which Nikolitch had left behind him; and in
the event of any complication arising, I should have
to trust to my wits to explain it away.</p>

<p>My intention was to march with Gatrina straight to
the house of the United States representative,
where, of course, she would be safe. I knew him
already for a man on whom I could rely implicitly.</p>

<p>Karasch went off to find the men and was to return
at midnight to report progress; and I was to go out
into the neighbourhood of Gatrina&#8217;s house to look
for a place in which they could be placed. I was
getting ready when my eye fell upon Nikolitch&#8217;s uniform
and I tried it on. It was anything but comfortable
after the freedom of civilian&#8217;s dress; and
as I was much the broader man of the two, it was
an uncommonly bad fit.</p>

<p>But I had to get used to it; so I resolved on a dress
rehearsal of the part, and throwing on a long overcoat,
I put a revolver in my pocket and set out on
my quest, with Chris in close attendance at my heels.</p>

<p>The night was fine but moonless; and as the streets
of Belgrade were very badly lighted, there was not
much chance of my being recognised. The restaurants
and supper houses were busy enough, and the
flare of their lights streamed across the streets here
and there; but they were easy to avoid; and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
were none of them in the neighbourhood of Gatrina&#8217;s
house.</p>

<p>As it was of course necessary that I should make
myself as familiar with the entrances to the house as
possible, I had a good look at it, being careful to keep
well in shadow.</p>

<p>A massive stone house, it stood by itself at a corner
and was almost surrounded by a high wall. The main
door let out on to a broad thoroughfare; a strong
massive door with a deep portico. In the wall at the
side there was a smaller doorway&mdash;the servants&#8217; entrance,
I concluded; and this, also, was very heavily
and strongly fashioned. All the lower windows were
heavily barred, a custom I had observed to be general
in the large houses in the city.</p>

<p>It was altogether a house capable of offering stout
resistance to any attack; and I saw in a moment that
if I could once get inside, with a few resolute men, it
would be possible to hold it for a long time against
either mob or troops; and I concluded that, in common
with many others in the city, it had been
strengthened in view of the turbulent outbreaks
which had been frequent enough in Belgrade.</p>

<p>The strength of the house reassured me somewhat
until I found a weak spot. Some fifty yards along
the smaller street were the stables; and I remembered
that when I had been in the house on the previous
day waiting in my vain attempt to see Gatrina, I had
noticed a newly made door at the end of the garden,
just at the point where, as I could now see, it would
lead to the stables; while from the room where I had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span>
been placed, a French window quite unprotected led
down a flight of steps to the garden path.</p>

<p>That was a weak spot indeed. But if it would render
the house open to attack, it would also provide
the means by which I could gain access if the need
arose.</p>

<p>I was weighing all this in my mind most earnestly
as I stood opposite the entrance to the stable, when
Chris moved and growled. I silenced him, laying my
hand on his head, and drew back with him into the
deep shadow of a tree which stood in front of the
portico of a house, and listened.</p>

<p>He never warned me without cause; and soon I
caught the sound of approaching footsteps. I had
no wish to be seen, so I slipped into the portico and
pressed close against the wall, while I kept watch
on the newcomer. He came along at a quick pace
until he reached the stable, when he paused.</p>

<p>My first idea was that he was a servant who had
overstayed his hours of leave and was puzzling how
to get into the house without attracting notice.</p>

<p>But I was wrong. Presently he came out into the
roadway and stared at the upper windows of the
house. Then he went round to the front and again
he paused and stared up at the windows there; and
apparently not seeing what he sought&mdash;for the whole
house was now in darkness&mdash;he scratched his head
as if in perplexity, and came sauntering back toward
the stables.</p>

<p>He was very slow in his movements, and his slowness
irritated me. Presently a light shewed for an
instant in one of the top windows at the back, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>
was almost instantly extinguished. This was repeated
twice, at short intervals; and I heard the
window raised very cautiously.</p>

<p>It was evidently the signal for which the man in
the street had been waiting, for he whistled, just two
notes softly, shewed himself in the roadway and
then stepped back in the shadow of the stables and
waited.</p>

<p>A vulgar assignation, I thought then, not without
disgust; and I wished that he and his sweetheart
would be quick over their love-making. It was
well past eleven. At midnight I had to be back to
receive Karasch&#8217;s report; and yet could not venture
to be seen.</p>

<p>But it was no sweethearting. After some minutes,
a small door in the large stable gate was opened and
a man looked out. I could see all that passed by the
light of a lamp over the gates. The two whispered
together a moment; and then the man from the
house came out, turned the key in the lock, and put
it in his pocket.</p>

<p>They both crossed the road toward where I stood,
and I pressed yet closer against the wall and kept my
hand on Chris&#8217;s head lest by a sound he should betray
our presence. They did not enter the portico, but
stood in the shadow of the tree where I had first concealed
myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will do,&#8221; I heard one of them say; and then
strain my ears as I would I could not catch any other
than isolated words. But they were enough to set
me on fire. &#8220;Army,&#8221; &#8220;Arrest,&#8221; &#8220;Three hours,&#8221;
&#8220;Yes, two o&#8217;clock&mdash;&#8221; this was louder and in an impatient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
tone. After that there was a chink of money
passing; and then silence. It lasted so long that,
unable to contain myself, I peered out cautiously and
looked at them.</p>

<p>The man who had come from the house was counting
a quantity of paper money, and trying to read
the value of each bill by the flicker of the lamp across
the road. It was a tedious business; and his companion
whispered something to him and they both
walked away along the street.</p>

<p>My first inclination was to follow them at once
and force an explanation; but I checked the impulse.
I resolved to wait for the return of the servant. He
was sure to come back, if I read the thing aright. I
could deal with him alone much more satisfactorily.</p>

<p>I took Chris across to the stable gates and making
him understand that he was on guard and must let
no one pass in, I returned to my hiding-place.</p>

<p>The minutes were leaden as I stood waiting. The
man was so long away that I began to fear I had
blundered and to regret I had not acted on the impulse
to follow the two.</p>

<p>But he came at length hurrying from the opposite
direction; and he glanced up at the house windows as
he passed, with a gesture of uneasiness. When he
reached the stable gates, Chris received him with
a low growl, and he started back in some dismay at
the most unexpected interruption.</p>

<p>He was trying to pacify the dog with a little coaxing
when I crossed to him and, assuming a tone of
authority, asked, at a venture; &#8220;You have seen the
sergeant? Why have you been so long?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>He was obviously in much perplexity and some
fear, and glanced from Chris to me. The good dog
looked formidable enough to have frightened a
braver man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>I threw back my long coat and shewed my uniform.</p>

<p>&#8220;The plan is changed. You are to come with me.
We can&#8217;t trust you out of sight again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced round as if meditating flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dog will pull you down if you move,&#8221; I said,
sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get in,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;I shall keep my
word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear what I ordered you?&#8221; I rapped
back with an oath. &#8220;Come,&#8221; and I linked my arm in
his to drag him away. He resisted at first; but at
a word from me Chris shewed his fangs and snarled
so angrily that no resistance was left in him. I let
go his arm then. &#8220;A false step or a single word, and
the dog&#8217;s fangs will close on your throat,&#8221; I muttered
fiercely.</p>

<p>He came then, keeping pace anxiously with my
quick stride and glancing ever and again over his
shoulder at Chris who stalked behind him like a
black shadow.</p>

<p>I got him to my house without trouble; for the
streets were now all but deserted, and I chose a way
which avoided the main roads.</p>

<p>I led him into my study, taking Chris with me,
and then turned a lamp full on his face. Then I drew
my revolver and held it in his full view as I considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
how best to question him, so as to get the truth out
of him.</p>

<p>It was a vital matter, and they were anxious moments;
for upon his answers Gatrina&#8217;s life might depend.</p>

<p>He found them anxious, too. I could see that by
his pallor, the nervous twitchings of hands and features,
the sweat that stood on his swarthy forehead,
and the wild look on his fear-filled eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV.<br />


<small>THE NIGHT OF TERROR.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The fear which my prisoner displayed led me to
prolong the interval before I questioned him. It was
essential for my purpose that he should be thoroughly
frightened; and the suspense was enough to try much
stouter nerves than his. I let him have some two
or three minutes, therefore, so that his fears should
have full scope; and just as my first question was
on my lips, a happy thought occurred to me. I saw
that I could make valuable use of the Russian reputation
for doing ugly things.</p>

<p>He was more likely to fear the Russians than any
other party concerned; and if I could make him believe
he had now fallen into their hands, he would
be far more likely to answer my questions than if I
played the more difficult part of an army officer,
believing him false to the army.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand over there,&#8221; I cried, sternly and suddenly
in Russian, pointing to the wall; and the start he
gave at hearing the unwelcome language, proved to
me that I was right. He moved to where I pointed,
his eyes on me all the time. &#8220;Attempt to move and
the dog will be on you,&#8221; I added, as brutally and
coarsely as I could.</p>

<p>Then I rang the bell, and when Buller came I said
in Russian; &#8220;Tell General Minzkoff I have the prisoner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
and am questioning him.&#8221; But Buller didn&#8217;t
understand Russian and stood staring at me in
hesitation what to do; so to give the thing colour, I jumped
up, swore vigorously, and, as if in a paroxysm of
rage, thrust him violently out of the room, pretending
to kick him, as I shouted: &#8220;Do as I say at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>I flung myself back in my seat only to jump up
again and, as though I had forgotten something rushed
out of the room after Buller. I explained matters,
and told him to find a servant who could speak Russian
and send him to me to say that &#8220;I was to see
General Minzkoff with my report as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>This particular Russian officer had just the reputation
for violence that was certain to impress the spy;
and the more bullying and brutal I could make my
manner, the more characteristic would it be of the
general&#8217;s agents.</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak my language?&#8221; I jerked out in Russian.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand it a little,&#8221; he answered with difficulty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll use your own cursed tongue,&#8221; I said
in Serb. &#8220;I have no time to waste over you, so
if you don&#8217;t answer plainly I&#8217;ll find means to make
you. How much money did that soldier give you
just now?&#8221;</p>

<p>He started at finding I knew this and looked about
for a lie. &#8220;Money? I don&#8217;t understand your Excellency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s in that pocket.&#8221; I pointed to where I had
seen him place it. &#8220;Take it out, you lying dog.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
Quick,&#8221; I thundered, as he still hesitated. &#8220;I know
everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly, for it cost him a pang to part with it, he
drew out the bundle of bills. &#8220;It is my own,&#8221; he
faltered.</p>

<p>&#8220;The gold, too. Quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he trembled, but dared not refuse. I had now
impressed upon him that I knew his secrets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put it there,&#8221; I said, pointing to a chair. &#8220;Now.
I&#8217;ll test your power of speaking the truth. What was
that money paid for?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at me in a sweat of fear, trying to
moisten his parched lips with a tongue as dry as
leather, wishing to lie but yet afraid; and in his
fright unable to coin a plausible tale.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was money&mdash;owing to me,&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>I paused a moment to let him hope the lie had imposed
upon me; and then pointed to the bell. &#8220;If
that bell is rung it will bring my men here with the
means you may have heard we use to make prisoners
speak the truth. Go and ring it now&mdash;or tell me the
truth of your own accord.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a touch of refined cruelty eloquent of Russian
methods to make him summon his own torturers;
and it did much to carry conviction now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to deceive your Excellency,&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that why you want me to believe that when a
man owes you money he comes in the dead of night
to pay it after waiting for your signals from the
house&mdash;the light three times flashed. You lying
cur. Ring that bell&mdash;I have no more time to waste.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>&#8220;You won&#8217;t torture me?&#8221; he cried, in anguish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ring that bell,&#8221; I thundered. &#8220;It pleases me for
you yourself to call your torturers;&#8221; and I laughed,
as if the grim joke were really to my taste.</p>

<p>Down he went on his knees. &#8220;Not the torture,
Excellency. Not the torture. For God&#8217;s sake, not
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had a taste of it before, eh?&#8221; I said, with
another grin, feeling an awful beast as I did it. &#8220;You
can choose&mdash;the torture or the truth of your own
will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; he exclaimed, covering his white face
and writhing; and then the truth came slowly and
with labour, as he thought how little he dared to
tell and yet save his skin. &#8220;It was for my mistress&#8217;s
sake&mdash;the Princess. We were all afraid in the house
because we are so weak. I had arranged to let some
soldiers in to protect us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must do better than that, dog. Try again,&#8221;
I sneered, coarsely. &#8220;Men don&#8217;t pay you to come
and protect you. You&#8217;ll have to lie better than that
to convince me.&#8221; Then I changed the sneer to a
tone of anger. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have no more of this; the truth,
or&mdash;&#8221; and I laid my hand on the bell.</p>

<p>At that moment the man Buller had sent with the
message in Russian came in and delivered it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good,&#8221; I said to him; and added; &#8220;Tell
black Ivan and Loris to come the instant I ring. I
find I shall need them. They know what to bring
with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bluff worked. I saw that the instant the servant
left the room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you one minute; no more,&#8221; I declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell your Excellency all I know,&#8221; he stammered
at once. &#8220;I was paid to let the soldiers into
the house at two o&#8217;clock in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what purpose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For what purpose?&#8221; I repeated sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that I appeared to fly into a passion. I seized
the revolver and going up to him clapped it to his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer me, or I&#8217;ll scatter your brains here on
the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shrank and groaned as he felt the cold steel on
his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;To arrest the Princess, Excellency. Oh, my God,
my God,&#8221; he cried and burst into tears.</p>

<p>I went back to my seat. &#8220;You are a faithful servant
to your mistress. Do you know what&#8217;s going to
happen to-night&mdash;the night you&#8217;ve chosen for this
infamy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;N&mdash;no. Yes,&#8221; he changed his words almost
eagerly as he caught my eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it words then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They told me it was for her safety, Excellency.
They did, they did, I swear they did, on my soul.
When the King and Queen and the others are taken
from the Palace, the Princess would be in danger in
her house, and they mean to put her in a place of
safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was news, indeed; and in my consternation at
hearing it, this coward and his treachery became of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
little importance. I did not doubt he was speaking
the truth about that, whatever his own motives may
have been for his act. And then a plan occurred to
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many men were to carry out the arrest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know&mdash;only a few; four or five at most,
we have no means of resisting them in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are to let them in by the stable door?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Excellency, at two o&#8217;clock. They could
force their way in even without my help.&#8221;</p>

<p>I paid no heed to his attempt at exculpation.
&#8220;What is your name? The name they know you
by?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Michel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How many men servants are in the house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two besides myself. Two are away, Excellency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyone sleeping in the stables?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one, Excellency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any of the others know of your plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Excellency.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the key of that stable door. Give it to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed it over with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have saved your skin,&#8221; I said curtly; &#8220;but
you must remain here. You will be safe, if you make
no effort to resist. If you do that, I shall leave orders
that you are to be shot.&#8221; I said this much as though
it were my daily custom to catch men and murder
them; and the very tone I used added to his fears.</p>

<p>I left him a minute in the care of Chris; and
as Karasch had arrived I told him to have the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
bound and locked up in one of the many vaults in the
basement of the house.</p>

<p>I was glad to be relieved of his presence, and then
set to work to carry out the scheme which his story
had suggested. When Karasch came back I told him
what I had learnt and asked him how he had fared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Except the handful of men on whom I knew I
could trust, I have done little,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;They may be enough for my altered plans. Can
you get them to-night, and above all can you get uniforms
for them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear not, Excellency. It is past midnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get the men then. I&#8217;ll find uniforms for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My plan is to go to the Princess&#8217;s house at once;
to wait for the men who are coming to arrest her;
make them prisoners and then play their part. They
will be able to provide us with the costumes,&#8221; I added,
smiling grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very dangerous,&#8221; was his comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean for them? Yes, it will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean for you, and all of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If anyone is afraid, let him stay away. I can go
alone. It is no work for children, of course,&#8221; I exclaimed,
impetuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I deserved that from your Excellency?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Karasch; I know you haven&#8217;t. I am excited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what has to be done; and I will do it,&#8221;
he said, simply; and then we discussed very hurriedly
the plan and completed the preparations which
had to be made.</p>

<p>I told him to meet me near the Princess&#8217;s house<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
with as many of the men as he could get together,
and to bring with him a few lengths of stout cord
for binding the soldiers we hoped to capture. That
made clear I packed him off to hunt up his men.</p>

<p>It was a desperate step I had resolved to take, and
the penalty of failure would probably be serious. I
realised that to the full; but on the other hand, I
could see no other means of gaining my end.</p>

<p>If Gatrina would have listened to me, the course
would have been simple enough. I could have given
her warning of her danger and have removed her to
a place of safety. But she would not let me approach
her nor admit there was anything perilous to her
in the situation. Thus, if I was to save her it must
be done against her knowledge and almost against
her will.</p>

<p>I left my house about half an hour after midnight,
having appointed with Karasch to be at the Princess&#8217;s
by half past one, or as near to that hour as he could
reach there. In no event was he to be later than a
quarter to two, even if he had to come alone.</p>

<p>Having ample time, I resolved to make a detour
and see if any movements were going on in the
neighbourhood of the Palace. With Chris close at
my heels I walked at a rapid pace, choosing the most
unfrequented ways I could find.</p>

<p>The whole city appeared sunk in the slumber of
unsuspecting security. Scarcely a light glimmered
in any one of the houses. The streets were deserted,
and the only sounds to disturb the quietude were
those of my own footsteps. If the army were really
going to move that night, they must have kept their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
intentions entirely secret from all who were not concerned
in their work.</p>

<p>One o&#8217;clock was chimed as I came in view of the
Palace; and save for the sentries pacing their rounds
with mechanical steps, not a soul was to be seen. The
Palace itself was wrapped in comparative darkness,
the inmates secure in their belief in the fidelity and
watchfulness of their guards.</p>

<p>There was absolutely nothing to suggest that a violent
outbreak was on the very eve of consummation;
and that a deed of horror was in the making, the
shame of which would before morning spread to the
uttermost confines of the civilised world, to set men
seeking its parallel in the darkest epochs of history.</p>

<p>I turned from the Palace, indeed, hoping and more
than half convinced that the spy had been misled, and
that if the army really nurtured thoughts of force,
their plans were not yet matured. I was intensely
relieved by this apparent dissipation of my gloomy
fears and at the same time profoundly perplexed as
to my own course.</p>

<p>If I forced my way in the dead of night into Gatrina&#8217;s
house and nothing occurred to justify my act,
discovery would overwhelm me with both confusion
and shame. In her eyes I should not only look like
a rash, intermeddling fool, but my conduct would be
open to a thousand misinterpretations, all ominous
and all ruinous to my hopes.</p>

<p>But I was not long to be a prey to these distracting
doubts. On leaving the Palace I hurried toward
one of the barracks; and then, all suddenly, on turning
the corner of one of the main streets, I heard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
measured tramp of many feet; and had just time to
conceal myself in the gateway of a house, when a
large body of troops passed me, marching in dead
silence.</p>

<p>They numbered some hundreds, marching straight
on the Palace; and I knew then, indeed, that trouble
was abroad and that my worst forebodings were to be
realised.</p>

<p>The night of terror for Belgrade had come; and
when I saw the strength of the force and thought of
Gatrina, my heart sank within me at the paltry effort
I was about to make to secure her safety. My plan
seemed so puny, so less than weak, so hopeless in
the face of this overawing display of force, that I
could have gnashed my teeth in despair.</p>

<p>I gazed after the troops, when they had passed,
like a fool bereft of his wits by fear, until a sound
broke and roused me from my lethargy.</p>

<p>The sound was that of gunshots in the direction
of the Palace. I guessed that the stern band had
met with some opposition from the guard, and that
the deadly work on which they were bent had already
commenced. They had staked their lives on the
issue; and even thus early, some had paid the forfeit.</p>

<p>It was just the spur my sluggish wits needed and
I slipped from my hiding-place and ran at utmost
speed in the direction of Gatrina&#8217;s house. It was
nearly a quarter to two when I reached it, to find
with intense satisfaction that all was still quiet there
and that Karasch had arrived and was awaiting me
with four companions.</p>

<p>Taking the utmost precaution to make sure we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
were unobserved, I unlocked the little door in the
stable gates and we entered. Locking it behind me,
and leaving the men at the end near the stable under
the shadow of some trees, Karasch and I stole up the
garden to the house, and found the unlocked door
by which the spy had left.</p>

<p>The time was so short before we were to look for
the coming of the soldiers that not a moment was
to be lost in finding a place where we could carry out
the plan of capture. Karasch, most thoughtfully,
had brought a lantern with him, and stealing noiselessly
through the passages, we explored the whole
of the underpart of the house; and I decided upon
two large cellars and explained to him hurriedly how
to act.</p>

<p>We would let the men in two at a time, Karasch
guiding one, I the other; and lead them each to a
different cellar, where we would overpower and bind
them. All would be in darkness on the plea that
suspicion had been aroused in the house and any
light would be dangerous; and as each man entered
the cellar he would be seized.</p>

<p>He fetched the men and by the light of the lantern
I had a good look at each. They were a sturdy,
resolute lot; and when we explained the work to be
done, they seemed to enter into it with willingness
and determination.</p>

<p>The traps were in readiness before the hour struck,
and Karasch and I went out again to the stable gate
to wait for the soldiers.</p>

<p>We stood in deep shadow and I then told him
what I had seen in the streets and of the firing I had
heard at the Palace.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>&#8220;The city will soon wake,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;And
if the people side with the troops, as I believe they
will, we shall soon have the mob here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will at least convince the Princess of the need
to fly.&#8221; I sought hard to persuade myself of this;
for my chief fear was that Gatrina herself would yet
prove the greatest difficulty.</p>

<p>We stood in silence for many minutes and now
and again the sound of hurrying footsteps without
told us that the news of the doings at the Palace was
spreading and that the people were scurrying to
learn what was going forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are late,&#8221; muttered Karasch, impatiently,
more than once; and then: &#8220;They are coming,&#8221; he
declared, as his quick ear caught the sound of slower
footsteps before I heard anything.</p>

<p>I soon heard them, however. They halted outside
the gates; and someone knocked. I opened
the little door a couple of inches and peered through.</p>

<p>There were six of them only.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, Michel?&#8221; came a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hsh. Yes. How many are there of you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Six.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is danger. I am suspected. You must
enter two at a time. I daren&#8217;t let you all pass together
through the garden. Cautiously, my friend,
cautiously,&#8221; I said, as someone tried to force the
door.</p>

<p>A consultation was held and the man who had
spoken to me explained to the rest what I had said.
Some difficulty was raised by one of the soldiers; but
I got my way.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>Two men slipped through the door as I held it;
and the instant the second was through, I locked it
behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Follow us,&#8221; I said, not giving either of them
time to see my face; and we led them to the house.
&#8220;Give me your hand,&#8221; I told the man with me. &#8220;We
daren&#8217;t have a light, and the place is pitch dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>He suspected nothing and I led him into the cellar,
clapping my hand on his mouth as he entered, while
the two men in waiting seized him and in less than
a minute he lay bound and gagged. The other had
been dealt with in the same way.</p>

<p>Karasch and I went back to the stables; but the
time occupied, swiftly as we had acted, had roused
some kind of suspicion; and when I opened the little
door, one of the men thrust the butt of his musket
in the way and despite my strenuous efforts, before I
could close it all four had forced themselves through.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go in together, my man,&#8221; said one of them,
linking his arm in mine and holding me firmly. Another
man did the same to Karasch.</p>

<p>It spelt crisis; and for a moment or two I breathed
hard. My fingers closed round my revolver, and his
life hung by a much thinner thread than he dreamt.</p>

<p>I stood fighting with the impulse and thus the
chance passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;See if he&#8217;s armed,&#8221; cried the soldier, and his companion
plunged a hand into my pocket and wrenched
my weapon roughly from me. Karasch was served
in the same way; and from the confidence of success
we were thus suddenly brought face to face with
the threat of disastrous failure.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV.<br />


<small>IN GATRINA&#8217;S HOUSE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>In the moment of crisis Karasch took his cue from
me and neither resisted nor protested against the
soldiers&#8217; conduct. I knew, however, that he would
watch me closely and be prepared to help the moment
I had decided what to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;ve done this,&#8221; I said to
the man who held me and had given the orders. &#8220;I
kept faith with you and you arrest me in return for
it.&#8221; I was on fire with anxiety, but I spoke coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can do without you now; and mean to see
you give no trouble,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; but if you cross the garden in a body
like this, there&#8217;ll be no call for me to give it you;
you&#8217;ll find it for yourself. You&#8217;ll be seen; the alarm
will be given, and you may look out for resistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there to resist, fool-head? There are
only three men in the house, and we&#8217;ve got two of
you here,&#8221; he growled with a chuckle at his own
cunning. &#8220;You come with us to the house; that&#8217;s
all you&#8217;ve got to do; and come quietly, or maybe
you won&#8217;t reach it. This is the army&#8217;s night, and
we&#8217;re not in a mood to be soft to those who resist
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that we moved on along the garden and I
was in a fever of apprehension lest we should be seen
by someone in the house. But the inmates were apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
fast asleep, and we reached the entrance
without being observed.</p>

<p>This increased my captors&#8217; suspicions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought your caution was overdone, friend
spy,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;re a fool,&#8221; I answered, bluntly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a dog about and if he scents you, he&#8217;ll soon
let everyone know. You&#8217;d better let me keep him
quiet.&#8221; I had told Chris to stay, and knew he would
remain till I called him.</p>

<p>We had entered the house then and stood in the
broad, stone-flagged passage; and I spoke loud
enough to warn our men in the cellars beyond. I
and the two men holding me were in advance and
Karasch and the others close behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hold your tongue. I&#8217;m in command here,&#8221;
said the soldier in a bullying tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made prisoners of us; so you must do
as you will. But I won&#8217;t stand this treatment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are my two men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I left them close here. I suppose they&#8217;ve gone
on into the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as dark as hell,&#8221; growled the fellow. &#8220;Can
you see anything, Andreas?&#8221; he asked his companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing but the dark,&#8221; was the answer with an
oath.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can get a light in the room first door to the
right,&#8221; I said. This was where I had left Chris, and
if he went to it I knew the dog would put him out of
the reckoning. But he smelt a trick and would not.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you, Mr. Spy. Where we go, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
come too. I can&#8217;t make out where the devil the
others are. What does it mean?&#8221; and he called the
men by name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t you better ring the alarm bell, while
you&#8217;re about it?&#8221; I sneered. &#8220;You&#8217;ll rouse everyone
more quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Curse the dark. Lead to where I can get a
light,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;No tricks, mind, or you&#8217;ll
regret it.&#8221;</p>

<p>His grip tightened on my arm and we moved forward
abreast. But the door was too narrow to admit
us all at once and he entered the room first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seize him, Chris,&#8221; I said in English; and out of
the gloom the huge black form sprang at him with
a fierce growl. In his consternation the soldier
loosed his hold of me to battle with the dog, and
in a moment my hand was on his companion&#8217;s throat,
while I called to the men in the cellars to go to the
help of Karasch who was now fighting and struggling
with his two guards.</p>

<p>We were six to three, for Chris kept the leader
busy; and the desperate struggle in the darkness
was soon over. The soldiers fought gamely enough;
but they had no chance against such odds. We overpowered
them, but it was not until some hard blows
had been given and taken on both sides.</p>

<p>I was most afraid for the man whom Chris had attacked;
but when I went to him was relieved to find
that no serious harm had been done. He was terribly
frightened; as well might be, for Chris was an
antagonist few men would care to fight. But having
got him down the good dog had not mauled him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>
The soldier lay flat on the ground, with Chris standing
guard over him and growling fiercely whenever
the man made the slightest movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call this brute off for God&#8217;s sake,&#8221; he said, in a
frightened voice as I approached, lantern in hand. I
was glad to hear him speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;It serves you right for the trick you played me,&#8221;
I answered. &#8220;Are you hurt?&#8221; and I called Chris
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought he&#8217;d kill me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t have been much loss if he had,&#8221; said
I, as he sat up and began to feel himself all over.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to shoot the brute. What does this all
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you&#8217;re my prisoner instead of my being
yours. If you have any weapons put &#8217;em out&mdash;or
I&#8217;ll let the dog find them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced round fearsomely at Chris, who
snarled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll tie you up like the rest of your men,&#8221;
I answered; and tied up he was. &#8220;I shall leave you
here,&#8221; I told him. &#8220;The dog will be on watch if
you try any tricks; and you know whether you want
another round with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our victory was complete; and it remained to see
how we should use it. Karasch and the others set
to work to take the soldiers&#8217; uniforms and put them
on, while I tried to think what step to take next.
I was in possession of the house; but it seemed as if
the real difficulties of the business were only at the
beginning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>The noise made during the struggle was so great
that I knew the household must have been roused,
and while the men were getting into the soldiers&#8217;
uniforms, I listened with considerable anxiety for
someone to come down to us. No one came, however;
and I concluded that those who had been
aroused had also been so frightened that they preferred
to stop where they were.</p>

<p>The difficulty of the position was increased by
my reluctance to see Gatrina or be seen by her, if
that could be in any way prevented. My plan was to
play his burlesque of arresting her, and not to shew
my hand until she was housed safely in the care of
the American Minister. To do that I intended one
of the four men whom Karasch had brought to act
the part of leader; and I trusted that in the confusion
and alarm of the arrest, both Karasch and I might
manage to pass unnoticed.</p>

<p>I was revolving all this in my thoughts when I
heard a movement above stairs, and presently a
man&#8217;s voice called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that you, Michel? What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come down,&#8221; I called in response; but my voice
startled him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Michel wants you. There is trouble. Come
down;&#8221; but he would not. Instead of coming he
went away; and I heard the low murmur of voices
as he spoke with someone else.</p>

<p>Lights shewed then, and I heard people moving
about. But I did not want the house to be lighted
up, for fear of its attracting too much notice outside;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
and I therefore called to my men to make haste
with their dressing.</p>

<p>When they came I led the way upstairs to find
the servants huddled together looking very scared;
the two men in front of them armed. At the sight
of so many of us in uniform they uttered cries of
surprise and alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put those guns down,&#8221; I said, in a tone of command.
&#8220;We are too strong for you to resist; and
if you make any attempt, it will only lead to trouble.
Do as I say, and no harm will come to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men hesitated. &#8220;What do you want?&#8221;
asked one of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cover them,&#8221; I said, stepping to one side, and
up went my men&#8217;s guns to their shoulders.</p>

<p>One of the women screamed and they all huddled
back, while the men laid their weapons on the
ground with discreet speed. At a sign from me the
muskets were lowered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put out most of those lights,&#8221; I said next; and
the order was obeyed with a celerity that spoke
volumes for the impression we had created. &#8220;Where
is your mistress, the Princess Gatrina?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In her rooms, sir,&#8221; said one of the women servants.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell her to dress at once. She is to come with
us. Impress upon her that only her safety is being
considered. Strange things are doing in the city,
and she cannot remain here. She must be ready to
go with us in five minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl sped away up the broad stairs and I
turned to Karasch to tell him my plan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>&#8220;The Princess will probably demand to see us;
and as neither you nor I can go to her without being
recognised, two of these must go. Pick them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He chose two, and I told them what to say. That
we had been selected to protect the Princess and
take her to a place where she would be safe until the
trouble in the city had passed.</p>

<p>The maid came back and her message was pretty
much what I had anticipated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Her highness will see you in a minute, sir. She
wishes to know from whom you come; and declares
she will not leave the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our orders are peremptory. In five minutes
she must go with us,&#8221; I replied, and she carried the
message.</p>

<p>While we waited for the reply I went into the
room where I had once before been, and saw that
my fears as to the unguarded window were only too
well justified. I called Karasch&#8217;s attention to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we have to remain in the house that window
must be barricaded, or we may as well throw open
the front door,&#8221; I said; and we were discussing it
when I heard one of the maids say to the other
servants that the street in the front of the house was
getting full of people.</p>

<p>We went and looked out. It was only too true;
and that it probably had a very sinister meaning for
us all I knew to my infinite concern.</p>

<p>The city was indeed awaking to a knowledge of
the dread doings of the night of terror, and the
crowd was beginning to gather here in expectation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
that the house would become the scene of some stirring
and exciting act of the tragedy.</p>

<p>I noticed with relief, however, that no troops were
present. None had been sent yet under the belief
that Gatrina would be made prisoner by the handful
of men whose parts we were now playing. But
how long this belief would continue it was impossible
to conjecture.</p>

<p>Someone somewhere was waiting to receive the
Princess from the hands of the men; and when they
did not arrive with her, the sands of patience would
be few and would soon run out, and a fresh guard
sent to know the reason. When they came, they
would bring a heap of trouble with them; unless I
could hurry Gatrina from the house in time.</p>

<p>The need for haste was thus imperative; and I
fretted and worried at the delay she made, all unconscious
as she was of the peril it meant to her
and all.</p>

<p>The instant the five minutes&#8217; grace had expired,
I sent the two men upstairs to bring her down,
despatching one of the scared maid-servants to shew
them her room.</p>

<p>At that moment we heard sounds below and Chris
growled and barked. Karasch and I, followed by
the two men, ran down instantly and found trouble;
one of the soldiers, carelessly bound, had wriggled
out of his cords and liberated a companion; and as
we reached the bottom of the stairs, the two were
in the passage with the dog blocking the way to the
door and snarling fiercely.</p>

<p>We rushed toward them, but they slipped into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>
room where Chris had had the fight with the leader;
and slamming the door in our faces, set up a clatter
loud enough to wake the dead.</p>

<p>Karasch and I dashed ourselves against the door
and as we strained to force it, we heard the crash of
glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;The garden, Karasch,&#8221; I cried; and we unfastened
the door and rushed out. Chris darted out
with a growl and in a moment had brought one of
the men to bay. The other fled toward the stable
and we ran in pursuit of him. But he was a quick,
agile fellow, and using the little door at the end as
a means of escape, he sprang up it, mounted the wall
and disappeared&mdash;to carry the news of our doings
heaven alone knew where.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back to the house, Karasch. We must get
away before that man can bring help.&#8221; We took
back his comrade, thrust him into a room, turned
the key upon him, and hurried again up the stairs.</p>

<p>Matters were going against me in the house also;
and I was beginning to realise that I had grievously
bungled matters in choosing such a method to serve
Gatrina.</p>

<p>She had done precisely what, if I had not been a
dolt, I might have known a girl of her courage and
resolution would do. She had used the minutes of
grace to barricade herself into the room.</p>

<p>The men were waiting for me with the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has fastened herself into her room, she and
her maids, and we could hear them piling things
against the door to keep us out. We tried to call
your message through the door, but at first she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>
wouldn&#8217;t answer; and then she said she was quite
safe where she was and would yield to nothing but
force. We didn&#8217;t like to force the door without
your orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>I clenched my hands in impotent chagrin. Had
we been the soldiers whose part we were playing,
there would have been little enough difficulty, of
course; and a few minutes would have sufficed to
break a way in and take her prisoner.</p>

<p>But force was out of the question for me; and I
felt like a flustered fool as the infinitely precious
moments slipped away one after another bringing
perilously nearer the troops who would come hurrying
to the house the instant the man who had
escaped got his story to headquarters.</p>

<p>To add to the strain of the situation, cries and calls
began to be heard from the crowd in the street.
Presently a stone was flung through one of the
windows; and the crash of the glass sent a shiver of
fear through the clustered servants and was followed
by a loud cheer from the crowd and a cry of &#8220;Down
with the Obrenovics!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shew me the Princess&#8217;s room,&#8221; I said, and followed
by the men I ran upstairs and knocked on
the panel of the door.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>I knocked again.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake open the door and come out,&#8221; I
said, eagerly.</p>

<p>Still there was no reply; and while we waited more
stones were flung and more windows broken, followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>
as before by the shouts and hoarse cries of the
mob.</p>

<p>But not a sign would Gatrina make in response
to my knocking and appeal.</p>

<p>Every second was bringing the danger nearer&mdash;and
it was growing to a double peril now; for Karasch
brought me word that the mob was increasing
fast in numbers and were growing so angry that it
looked as though they would attack the house.</p>

<p>I clamoured again at the door and called out that
there was imminent danger; but either she did not
hear my voice because of the clamour of the people
without, or hearing it, did not recognise the tone;
and held it to be a ruse of the soldiers to induce her
to open the door.</p>

<p>I felt just mad as I cursed my stupidity for having
planned this soldier business, which had thus driven
Gatrina to regard these desperate efforts of ours to
save her as the violence of her enemies bent upon
her destruction.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the temper of the populace without
was rising so fast that it seemed as if a few minutes
would make escape from the house impracticable for
us all, even if more troops did not arrive.</p>

<p>I hammered again at the door and called her in
my loudest tones; I told the servants of the peril in
which she stood if we could not get her away, and
urged them to join with me in appealing to her to
yield. But it was all to no purpose. Not a word
would she answer either to them or to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get me paper quickly,&#8221; I told them; and when
one, a white-faced girl, rushed away on the errand, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
whistled up Chris and set him barking in the hope
that she would hear him and know by the sound
who was there.</p>

<p>Chris succeeded where I had failed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; It was Gatrina&#8217;s voice; and
hearing it the dog whined and barked joyfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Chris,&#8221; I called. &#8220;We are here to save
you. Open the door for the love of God at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that speaking?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is I, Bourgwan,&#8221; I replied, my voice unsteady
in my excitement. &#8220;There is not a moment to
lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the soldiers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will explain all. For God&#8217;s sake come or it
will be too late. Every second is precious.&#8221;</p>

<p>We heard them drag away something they had
placed before the door; and burning with impatience
called again to them to make haste.</p>

<p>At that moment a loud knocking came at the front
door of the house; and one of Karasch&#8217;s men came
running to say that the soldiers were in the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;We daren&#8217;t stay to be caught in these uniforms.
We shall be shot off-hand at a time like this,&#8221; he
said; and the others agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be shot by me if you attempt to desert
me now,&#8221; I answered desperately. &#8220;Before anyone
can get in, we shall be away. Stop them, Karasch.
In a few moments we shall all be away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again there came the loud knocking and clanging
of the bell, followed by the cries of the mob and
another shower of stones at the house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>Unable to hold their courage longer my men
turned and ran down the stairs helter-skelter.</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s calm without and in the
silence the room door unlocked and Gatrina came
out.</p>

<p>Not recognising me for an instant in the surprise
at seeing my officer&#8217;s uniform, and Karasch by me
dressed also as a soldier, she started back as if fearing
treachery; but Chris rushed up to her and disarmed
her fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would God you had come out before,&#8221; I cried.</p>

<p>Before she could reply we heard the sound of a
scuffle and two of the men came running back.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are too late. The soldiers are already in
the house below,&#8221; cried one, breathlessly. &#8220;We are
as good as dead men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even Karasch changed colour at the news.</p>

<small>CHRIS TO THE RESCUE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>It was the delay which had been fatal to the plan.
The minutes during which we had had to wait before
Gatrina could be made to understand who we were
and what our object was had just turned the balance
against us.</p>

<p>&#8220;What dreadful thing has happened?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot spare a moment to explain. If you
will play the part of being my prisoner there is yet a
chance of getting away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; she said, as her maid brought her
a cloak and hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence there,&#8221; I cried in a loud voice. &#8220;Fall in.
I am sorry my duty is so unpleasant, your highness;
but I can answer no questions. Forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>I led the way motioning to Karasch to walk at
Gatrina&#8217;s side, with two of the men in front and two
bringing up the rear. The women thinking the
thing real began to weep.</p>

<p>I had heard the soldiers coming up and they met
us on the stairs. The only chance was to put as
bold a face as possible on the matter and with as
much show of authority as I could assume, I said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the way from the house clear? I shall take
the prisoner by the back through the garden.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>I had expected to be faced by some of the men we
had fought with earlier, but to my intense relief there
were none but private soldiers and one sergeant; and
on seeing my captain&#8217;s uniform they stood aside and
saluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have not been to the back of the house, captain,&#8221;
replied the sergeant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Colonel Petrosch here yet?&#8221; I asked this as
I thought the mention of the name might impress
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s in command of the soldiers in the front?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Bulver, captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he in sufficient force to control the mob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has a strong body of troops, captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing in the house?&#8221; I was curious
to know whether the escape of the soldiers had
anything to do with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were detailed to see if the arrest had yet been
made, captain, and to assist you if necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>I breathed a little more freely.</p>

<p>&#8220;All I need is that the mob there be kept in the
front of the house so that I can get away with the
prisoner quietly at the back. That side street must
be cleared of people. How did you get into the
house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We forced a small door at the side, captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>This accounted for his not knowing anything of
what had gone on below stairs in the basement.</p>

<p>Then came the sound of more hooting and groaning
from the front of the house; and another volley
of stones breaking more of the windows. This in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
turn was followed by sharp words of command; and
a knocking at the front door.</p>

<p>Keeping up my policy of bluff, I opened it myself.
The officer was on the step and started in surprise
at seeing me. He was a pleasant-faced young
fellow, and taking me for a superior officer was disposed
to offer an apology. Bluff is an excellent
policy while you can keep your end up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I thought only a sergeant was here,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I deemed it best to come myself,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you keep the crowd in order?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are very strong and inclined to violence.
We&#8217;ve driven them back for a bit; but I&#8217;ve sent for
more men.&#8221;</p>

<p>I knew they would be on hand sooner than he
thought or I wished; but I replied, seriously: &#8220;Very
prudent. This sort of thing is not what we want
at all. The house was to be protected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We did not look for such a demonstration,&#8221; he
said again, apologetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I have made the arrest, but I had more
trouble than I anticipated; there was a stout resistance.
I wish to take the prisoner away without exposing
her to the mob. Let your men clear the side
street of people, and prevent anyone passing into it.
I shall leave the house by the garden through the
stables.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are strong enough to protect her from the
crowd.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer the other way, lieutenant. Be good
enough to see my order carried out,&#8221; I replied
sharply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have it done at once,&#8221; and he went away.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better help the lieutenant, sergeant;
he will need all the men he can have.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this way I got rid of him and his men also,
and I shut the door again, with a fervent sigh of
thankfulness that my imposture had not been detected.
I had caught the lieutenant eyeing me curiously
more than once during the short colloquy;
but I concluded that he took me for one of the
officers who had been drafted in from the provincial
regiments for the grim work of that night. And
probably my air and tone of authority had stopped
him from putting any questions which I should have
found exceedingly hard to answer.</p>

<p>Whatever his reasons, I had succeeded in bluffing
him, even at the very moment when I had given
up all as lost; and my hopes began to rise that even
in the teeth of all this force and despite the anger
of the mob, Gatrina would be saved.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make for the garden at once,&#8221; I said; and
we passed through the room with the French window
opening on to the garden, and hurried to the
stables.</p>

<p>As we passed we could hear the troops clearing
the street amid the expostulations and cries of the
crowd, as they were swept on toward the front.</p>

<p>Until now Gatrina had not spoken to me, but we
had to wait while the way was cleared and we stood
side by side and a little apart from the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have run a terrible risk, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221;
she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>&#8220;I have been in no danger; and we shall get away
all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened at the Palace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I got wind of this intended arrest
of you and came here in the hope of intercepting
the soldiers. As I was on my way, a very large
body of troops, some hundreds of men, passed me
marching on the Palace; and afterwards I heard the
sound of firing. But what occurred after that I
have no knowledge whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>She wrung her hands despairingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think&mdash;oh, God, it is maddening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the work of the army. I know so much.
And I hope they have done no more than to force
an abdication.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that as if you feared&mdash;I know not what
horrors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we once get clear of this we shall find out
what has occurred. But we could do nothing if we
wished. You have seen for yourself the temper
of the people. They have sided with the army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean the attack on my house?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. The city is mad to-night, and would do
anything. The only thing to think of now is your
safety. Karasch, look over if we can go yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was on fire with impatience to be away; but
Karasch reported that the street was not yet clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there no other way we could escape?&#8221; I
asked Gatrina.</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;No, none,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not wait here, Karasch; we shall be
caught in a trap;&#8221; and opening the door in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>
stable gates I looked out; but only to shut it again
quickly as I caught my breath in dismay at what I
saw.</p>

<p>Another body of troops were coming towards us
at the double, and by the side of the officer in command
ran a man in his shirt sleeves. It was the
soldier who had escaped from us.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are too late,&#8221; I said, as calmly as I could
speak. &#8220;There are more troops, Karasch, and that
man is guiding them. We must go back to the
house and try to get away from the front.&#8221;</p>

<p>We hurried back through the garden, and before
we reached the house the newcomers were already
clamouring at the stable gates.</p>

<p>Dashing through the house I flung open the front
door.</p>

<p>But that way was impossible. The very orders I
had given, to have the crowd massed in the front of
the house, had effectually barred the chance of
escape. They had been driven from the side street
and were now surging and swaying in a dense mass
to the right of the house, too vast a crowd for me
to hope of pushing my way through them with the
handful of men I had.</p>

<p>To go to the left meant only running into the
arms of the fresh troops; certain capture.</p>

<p>I called Karasch and pointed to the hopelessness
of the attempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can do nothing. You and the men must
get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall stay with the Princess.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>&#8220;Then I stay too, with you,&#8221; he said sturdily.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you can do better. You can save us both.
You and the others. You can pretend to carry a
message from me to the lieutenant&mdash;that I want to
speak to him; and then lose yourselves among the
soldiers or in the crowd. Get away as fast as you
can, and search high and low to find Colonel Petrosch.
Don&#8217;t forget the name, and find him at any
hazard. Tell him that my life is in danger and that
he must come here if it is not to be lost. If he
questions you, tell him plainly all I have done. Now
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like leaving you,&#8221; he insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, man, don&#8217;t be a fool. It&#8217;s the
only way out of the tightest fix I was ever in. You
must reach him before he hears the news these
others are bringing. Go;&#8221; and I half pushed him
out of the house.</p>

<p>The rest were only too eager to be off, and I
watched breathlessly as Karasch crossed the cleared
space, spoke to the lieutenant, who looked over at
me and after hesitating, walked toward me.</p>

<p>As he came, I saw Karasch and his men move
back to the soldiers, push through the ranks, and
disappear in the crowd behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you done?&#8221; asked Gatrina.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have sent for someone who may get us out
of the mess I have been clever enough to get us
into. I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen first.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant entered the house then.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wish to speak to me, captain?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as well to you as to another. I&#8217;m only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
masquerading in this uniform. I am not an officer
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at me openmouthed in sheer amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;No officer?&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You soon will. There are those coming who
will make it all plain to you. But having misled
you purposely, I wished to tell you; that&#8217;s all.&#8221; I
spoke as coolly as though I had been announcing a
mere business fact.</p>

<p>&#8220;The soldiers who were with you?&#8221; he asked
then, glancing round as if in search of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are gone,&#8221; I told him.</p>

<p>Then we heard a noise in the basement. Loud
voices, the tramp of many feet, and a rush up the
stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait for them here,&#8221; I said to Gatrina,
pointing to a room at the back of the house; and we
all three went into it, Chris keeping close by her
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are my prisoner, sir,&#8221; said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall offer no resistance,&#8221; I replied, making it
sound as much like a concession on my part as I
could.</p>

<p>I put a chair for Gatrina and she sat down, while
I stood beside her.</p>

<p>The next minute the soldiers came crowding into
the room with the sergeant and men whose uniforms
we had taken in their midst. They were all
talking at once and gesticulating at once angrily,
making a sort of Babel of tongues, in which fierce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
denunciations of me were disquietingly loud and
conspicuous.</p>

<p>The officer in charge of the newcomers exchanged
a few words with the lieutenant, describing
excitedly the heinous deed of which I had been
guilty. I disliked the look of him intensely&mdash;a
heavy, red-haired bully of a man, and when he addressed
me he did so in a hectoring tone difficult to
hear without anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;ve arrived in time to take you red-handed,
my fine fellow, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Red-handed? In doing what?&#8221; I asked, meeting
his beetle-browed stare firmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to bluster with me. I&#8217;m the wrong
man,&#8221; he cried, hotly. &#8220;It won&#8217;t pay you, I promise
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was one of them, captain. I&#8217;ll swear to him.
And that&#8217;s the dog that flew at me,&#8221; said the sergeant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the beast out and shoot it,&#8221; ordered the
captain, brutally.</p>

<p>Chris was in no immediate danger of that fate,
however. Two of the soldiers went toward him
but he shewed his great fangs and looked so dangerous,
that they stopped and stepped back; and no
other volunteers offered for the job.</p>

<p>Angered at this the captain himself drew a revolver
and pointed it at the dog, but I checkmated
this by calling Chris round behind me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare to interfere with my orders,&#8221;
cried the bully, furiously.</p>

<p>I answered this by putting myself right in the line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>
of fire. &#8220;I will not have the dog shot in this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dog is in my house and under my protection,&#8221;
exclaimed Gatrina.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are my prisoners, both of you; and as for
you,&#8221; he said, with a coarse sneer to Gatrina, &#8220;your
day is done, and your protection will avail nothing.
You&#8217;ll find that out soon enough.&#8221; But he put up
his revolver; and as we had gained the point, it
wasn&#8217;t policy to anger him further with the hot
remonstrance that rose to my lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did this man give you his name?&#8221; he asked the
lieutenant, who shook his head and shrugged his
shoulders. I think he was more than a little
ashamed of his superior&#8217;s manner. &#8220;What&#8217;s your
name, prisoner?&#8221; demanded the captain next.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am perfectly willing to explain everything I
have done; but I should prefer to do so before a
smaller audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay you would, but you&#8217;re not in a position
to choose. I settle that. Now answer my
questions and don&#8217;t try to lie to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The colour leapt to my face at this. &#8220;There is no
need to insult me, captain. It will neither hurt my
case, nor help yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By God, if you don&#8217;t answer me at once I&#8217;ll
have you marched down into the garden there and
shot for a traitor and a cur.&#8221;</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t take that. It made me mad. Clipping
my words short I answered, deliberately:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that would be the better plan, then. It
will at least free me from the presence of a cad and
a bully; and the lieutenant there will, I am sure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
have the courage and justice to tell the truth of
your act.&#8221;</p>

<p>He swore a deep oath, beside himself with rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seize him,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;By God, seize him,
and take him out and shoot him.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was seized by three soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant, you will tell Colonel Petrosch how
I, his personal friend, have been condemned without
a hearing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Away with him,&#8221; shouted the captain, stamping
with rage. The men began to lead me away.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is murder, and shall not be done,&#8221; cried
Gatrina, jumping to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence, woman,&#8221; exclaimed the bully. &#8220;Your
doom is near, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not be silent while murder is being done.
I call upon all of you to stop this murder. You,
sir,&#8221; turning to the lieutenant. &#8220;You will not&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain, like a maniac in his fury at this interruption,
drew his sword and shouting out a vile
epithet, rushed at Gatrina, intending, I believe, to
strike her down.</p>

<p>But Chris, whose ominous growl at my treatment
I had had to pacify, went almost as mad at this as
the bully himself and with a savage growl launched
himself right at the captain&#8217;s throat, bore him to the
ground, and pinned him down, despite the blows
and kicks which the soldiers rained upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Loose him, Chris,&#8221; I cried, fearing the man
would be killed; and at my voice he obeyed. Then,
as he was looking up to me, one of the soldiers who
had picked up the captain&#8217;s sword slashed at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>
dog&#8217;s leg and when he dropped, the brute thrust
the blade between his ribs.</p>

<p>With a cry of rage I broke from the men who
held me and rushed to Chris, but Gatrina was before
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You coward!&#8221; she cried to the soldier, who
stood half gloating, half dismayed at his act; and the
next moment my fist crashed into his face, knocking
him sprawling among his comrades.</p>

<p>As I bent over my gallant dog, my heart full of
sadness and pity for him, I was seized again by the
men, and such a scene of confusion and riot followed
as baffles description.</p>

<p>They beat me, of course, and I was dragged back
and held panting, struggling, straining, breathing
out impotent threats, and cursing all who had had
a hand in the cruel work, as I strove vainly to get
again to the spot where Gatrina, white-faced and
pitying, knelt by the dear dog, who had so valiantly
given his life to save her.</p>

<p>Another group had the bully of a captain for its
centre. He was getting up, all bloody about the
throat where Chris had fastened on him, and madder
than ever with rage, gasped out a repetition of
his orders to have Gatrina seized and me taken
away and shot.</p>

<p>Still fighting with the men about me I was being
lugged and hustled and thrust out of the room,
oblivious to everything but my insensate rage, and
they had got me to the door when two officers entered
the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this riot?&#8221; cried one in a loud, stern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
tone; and the men about me started instantly at the
voice and I felt their grip on me to relax.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is murder; nothing else,&#8221; I shouted; and taking
advantage of my captors&#8217; surprise, I broke from
them and rushed back into the room to Gatrina and
my poor Chris.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he dead?&#8221; I asked her.</p>

<p>She looked up and I read the truth by the tears
in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor, faithful Chris,&#8221; she murmured, with a
deep sigh, as her hand gently caressed the great
head.</p>

<p>I could not speak. I had loved the dog so well&mdash;and
never better than in the manner of his death.
I bent over him for a moment with a feeling of
irreparable loss, as at the death of a friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;He gave his life for me, Bourgwan. Poor old
comrade,&#8221; murmured Gatrina using, unconsciously
I think, the old term.</p>

<p>In that moment the tie of our common sorrow for
the dog&#8217;s death brought us as close together as
even in those past days in the hills.</p>

<p>I made no reply. I could not. I was tongue-tied
by the hampering rush of mingled emotions.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII.<br />


<small>MY DEFENCE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The grip of a hand on my shoulder roused me
from my reverie. A couple of soldiers stood one
on either side of me; and as I turned I saw the red
brute of a captain being supported out of the room.
The officer who had arrived last had taken command
and was sitting at a table with the lieutenant
standing at his side. With much relief I recognised
him at once. He was a Major Kireef whom
I had met at the Palace reception.</p>

<p>I was placed in front of him, and two or three of
the soldiers took up positions by Gatrina. As the
major held my fate and perhaps my life in his hands,
I scrutinised him closely. He was a man between
forty and fifty years of age; his face strong but not
harsh; his manner peremptory as of one accustomed
to exact prompt obedience; but he gave me the impression
that he would deal justly even if sternly.
A vastly different type of man from the red-headed,
passionate beast whose place he had taken. And I
was heartily thankful for the exchange.</p>

<p>He glanced sharply at me and with a slight start
turned to some notes he had made of what the
others had told him. I guessed that he had some
recollection of my features and was probably looking
for my name.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>&#8220;You are Major Kireef, I think?&#8221; I said, while
his eyes were still on the papers. He looked up
quickly and frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not to question me,&#8221; he rapped out,
very curtly. Then: &#8220;I see no mention of your
name here. What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man who has just left was going to have
me shot without troubling to find out,&#8221; I replied,
getting that fact out as soon as I could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be good enough to remember you are a prisoner,
and that you will not help your case by either
evading my questions or attempting to bring
charges against others. Now, your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chase F. Bergwyn, a citizen of the United
States.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped his pen in surprise and half started
to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Bergwyn?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;It is not possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you can send a message to Colonel Petrosch
he will confirm what I say, major. I met you at the
Reception at the Palace just after my arrival in
Belgrade. You may remember me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had every cause to be satisfied with the effect
of my words. He paused a moment as if in doubt
what to do, and then waved back the soldiers who
stood by me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have the room cleared,&#8221; he said to the lieutenant.
&#8220;Put a chair for Mr. Bergwyn there.&#8221; I
moved my chair near to Gatrina and while the room
was cleared, he busied himself with his notes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>&#8220;Shall I remain, major?&#8221; asked the lieutenant,
when the men had gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for the present;&#8221; and the young officer
went back to his place, having to step over poor old
Chris, whose body, now that the place was empty,
lay in full view, a conspicuous, ghastly evidence of
the wild scene just ended.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must surely have been some unaccountable
mistake, Mr. Bergwyn?&#8221; he said, interrogatively
and courteously when we four were alone;
&#8220;judging, that is, by the extraordinary story which
has been told to me. I invite you to explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I asked the captain who has been hurt to allow
me to do so privately; but he declined. Let me
thank you for having cleared the room. There is
a further favour you can do me, and a much more
important one. Let someone go at once in search
of Colonel Petrosch. I won&#8217;t disguise from you I
have placed myself in a very awkward position, and
as he and I have had some very confidential relations&mdash;you
may perhaps know that&mdash;it is of vital
importance I should have his assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This matter is in my hands, and I must investigate
the facts before taking any other action. The
charges against you are very grave&mdash;if you are indeed
the person implicated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will put any questions I will answer
them,&#8221; I said, disappointed by his refusal of my
request.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have represented yourself as an officer of
the Servian army?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span>&#8220;You, with others who appear to have escaped,
violently ill-treated the guard who were sent here
to arrest this lady&mdash;Princess Gatrina?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may pass at that; although the ill-treatment
was not very violent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You set your dog on one of them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man was going to arrest me, and I would
not permit that. But he was not hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You then forcibly took from five of the men
their uniforms that your men might wear them as
a disguise and personate troops of the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyebrows went up and he pursed his lips and
shrugged his shoulders. Very ominous gestures.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who were the men with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I cannot answer. The responsibility is
mine and mine only. They were men whom I paid
to assist me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a very grave admission, Mr. Bergwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite aware of it. It&#8217;s a very tight corner,
indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was anyone cognisant of your plans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, certainly not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wearing a captain&#8217;s uniform. How did
you get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I borrowed it without leave&mdash;stole it, perhaps
I ought to say; except that I shall return it to the
owner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the owner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I cannot answer.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>&#8220;Yet you say no one&mdash;not even the owner of the
uniform&mdash;was in league with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even the owner of this uniform.&#8221;</p>

<p>He appeared to find this difficult to believe; and
it began to look as if I had done Nikolitch a bad
turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very extraordinary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you the truth, major. I give you
my word of honour as an American citizen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then as to your object. What was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wished to prevent the Princess Gatrina being
arrested by the army, and to place her in safety until
the passions of this night&#8217;s doings in the city had
cooled sufficiently for the officers to have time to
consider their course in regard to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am loath to take that answer, Mr. Bergwyn&mdash;it
only makes your case worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help that, major. It is the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You interfered deliberately to oppose the plans
of the army?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I interfered to prevent at least one deed of blood
being done in the frenzy of to-night&#8217;s passion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you to set yourself against the army,
sir?&#8221; he retorted very sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The English blood in my veins and my instincts
as an American citizen alike revolt against the insensate
violence of such an act as that intended, and
I used such means as I had to prevent it. I staked
my life on the issue; and if the army choose to claim
the forfeit, I will pay it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say such an act was intended?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The answer is supplied in what has occurred to-night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
at the Palace, Major Kireef. That I could not
prevent, although, God knows, I would have done
so had I had the power.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gatrina, who had been listening breathlessly to
all this, intervened then. &#8220;What has occurred at
the Palace?&#8221; she asked strenuously. &#8220;Surely no
violence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The King and Queen have come in conflict with
the troops, and their Majesties have lost their lives
in consequence.&#8221; The answer was given with cold
deliberation; and I took it for the official version of
Elma&#8217;s one word prophecy&mdash;assassination.</p>

<p>Gatrina was overcome by the news and threw herself
back in her seat, her face covered by her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they the only lives that have been&mdash;lost?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot answer you, Mr. Bergwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not; but you can at any rate see in my
question the reason for all I have done to-night&mdash;even
if to you it does not appear to be a justification.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The arrest of the Princess will of course take
place,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;and you, Mr. Bergwyn, will
have to answer to the army for what you have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready to face the band; but I am not the
only one who will have to do that. That red-headed
murderer who was here just now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot hear this,&#8221; he interposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s part of my case, if you please,&#8221; said I,
warmly. &#8220;He not only told the Princess, like the
coward he is, that she was to die, but he himself drew
his sword upon her. Then it was that my dog there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
flew at him&mdash;and I only wish he had torn his
cowardly life out of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may have an opportunity of defence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;May have,&#8217;&#8221; I cried, indignantly. &#8220;You are
talking to an American citizen, sir, and you&#8217;ll find
out how that Government views the acts of her
people when they try to prevent innocent blood
being shed, even if the acts themselves are wrong.
I demand, right now, to have the protection of my
country&#8217;s representative.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your crime has been committed against the
army, sir,&#8221; he said, coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crime? Crime you call it?&#8221; I answered, passionately.
&#8220;Crime? To tie up half a dozen men in
order to prevent a real crime, murder, being committed?
If mine is the crime, all I can say is I am
guilty of it, and would be guilty of it a hundred times
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This heat will serve no purpose, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221;
said the major, after a pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right there; we&#8217;ll have no more of it. I&#8217;ll
tell you how the thing arose&mdash;for I&#8217;ve nothing to
conceal;&#8221; and I told him plainly how I had overheard
the talk between the spy from Gatrina&#8217;s house
and just what I had done afterwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, if you&#8217;ll send out in search of Colonel
Petrosch, it will save much time, anxiety and trouble
for all concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must consider my course. I am not answerable
to Colonel Petrosch alone, I fear. The Princess
must be prepared to go with my men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go,&#8221; declared Gatrina, with instant readiness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span>&#8220;The Princess is already under arrest, Major
Kireef. She is at your disposal here just as much as
anywhere else. Why can she not remain until
Colonel Petrosch comes? I have his word of honour
that he will do everything in his power to protect
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have my duty to do, Mr. Bergwyn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure it cannot be your conception of duty
to place her where she will be in danger of her life.
It is but a matter of an hour or two. You are in
possession of the house. No attempt will be made
by her, I am sure, any more than by me, to escape;
and if it were made, you are in such force here that
it would be impossible. Let her remain here until
at least Colonel Petrosch arrives.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head. &#8220;My instructions are definite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll give you another reason. You know,
perhaps, the general nature of the matters which
have been discussed between Colonel Petrosch and
myself. The result of them may depend upon your
decision now. The Colonel would confirm this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He thought a moment. &#8220;I should like to do as
you wish. Will you give me your word of honour
to attempt no escape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, I will. If I&#8217;m to get out of this mess,
it will be by very different means, I assure you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He considered again for a space, and then rose.
&#8220;I accept your word, Mr. Bergwyn, and will leave
you while I send for Colonel Petrosch, and consider
what else to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>I gave a deep sigh of relief when he left the room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
I had pulled through the first stage; and that was
something. I glanced at Gatrina&#8217;s face, ashen,
horror-filled, and drawn with trouble and suffering.
I could not bear to witness it, so I turned away and
stared blankly out of the window into the darkness,
now changing rapidly to the grey of the dawn.</p>

<p>For a long time not a word was spoken. Her
agony of mind was far beyond words; and nothing
that I could do or say could relieve it.</p>

<p>She was not thinking of herself, I knew. All
thought of self, even the uncertainty of her own fate
involving as it did the issue of life and death, was
lost in the numbing, staggering blow dealt by the
news of the Queen&#8217;s murder.</p>

<p>Now and again a moaning sigh burst from her
lips and told me how acute was her agony. Twice I
turned to make some clumsy attempt at consolation;
but each time the look her face bore stopped the
words on my lips, and I turned back to watch the
light without strengthening slowly as the time crept
on.</p>

<p>I had one consoling thought. The longer the interval
between the fell occurrences at the Palace and
the coming of the soldiers for Gatrina, the stronger
grew the hope that she might escape the fate which
had been decreed for her.</p>

<p>That thought led me slowly to another&mdash;the necessity
of having a definite proposal to make as to
Gatrina&#8217;s future movements. I remembered what
Colonel Petrosch had said as to the wish of the army
that she would go from Belgrade.</p>

<p>Now that the King was dead, the question of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
succession had become acute. Gatrina&#8217;s presence
in the city might be a greater embarrassment than
before in the settlement of that question. I recalled,
too, Elma&#8217;s statement of the Russian scheme in this
respect. Even those who, like that brute of a captain,
had resolved to cut the knot of the difficulty
with a sword blade, might be glad to be relieved of
her presence.</p>

<p>Foul, dastardly, inhuman even, as was the policy
of assassination, it was yet founded upon a sort of
crude, barbarous logic. The resolve to exterminate
the dynasty was the murderous major premise; and
the relentless and hideous resolve to put to death all
who, by claims of family, stood in the way, followed
as a ruthless consequence.</p>

<p>That was Gatrina&#8217;s danger. But if she would consent
to abrogate her claims and could be prevailed
upon to leave the city at once, there was the chance
that she might even yet be spared. Colonel Petrosch
had avowed his desire to spare her; and if he could
be assured that she would offer no opposition to the
army, his hands would be greatly strengthened.</p>

<p>I might at least use the fact to induce him to allow
nothing to be done that night; and the delay of a few
hours might mean everything. I had calculated
throughout that when the wild passions of all concerned
in the night of horror had had time to abate,
the craving for blood even of the most reckless of
the reckless would cease. A reaction against further
violence would be almost certain to follow, and
counsels of sanity, reason and prudence would prevail
once more.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span>The light of day and the hours of reflection would
thus bring hope, and I watched the light increase
with unspeakable thankfulness. But question Gatrina
I must, and at length I went back to my seat and
turned to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must speak about yourself,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>In her absorption and suffering she had not
noticed my movement, and started nervously at the
sound of my voice; but said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your danger is not yet passed,&#8221; I continued;
&#8220;and when the officers return we must have something
definite to say about yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I care nothing for myself,&#8221; she murmured, desolately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your life is in danger, and you must care,&#8221; I
said, firmly. I must rouse her by some means.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they covet my life, let them take it&mdash;after
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not let you say that. You are speaking
now under the influence of these horrors, and from
the feelings of desperation which they naturally
prompt. But you must think of yourself, and you
shall. You have no right to throw your life away
because things have been done which you were
powerless to prevent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I fear death? If they covet my
life, let them take it,&#8221; she repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sacrifice of your life can do no good to
those who are already dead, Princess. It is only
cowardly to feel this indifference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather be a coward and die than beg
my life at the hands of these murderers. I will hear
no more.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>She spoke with more animation than before: and
so long as I could rouse her from the stupor of her
grief and horror, I knew I was doing good. If she
could be provoked to anger, so much the better. I
cared not what I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot avoid hearing me, and I am resolved
to speak,&#8221; I continued, deliberately. &#8220;And you owe
it to me to listen carefully.&#8221;</p>

<p>The curl of her lip shewed that she thought this
about as mean as it sounded. But she did not reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have heard me, and if you are not a
coward of another kind, you will reply.&#8221; I felt an
awful brute as I said this; but it had its effect. She
started up, clasping the arms of her chair and leaning
forward, looked at me with amazement, anger
and bitterness. But I went on doggedly: &#8220;Not
your life only but mine also is in the balance, and I
have the right to expect you to make an effort.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The right?&#8221; The words came like a flash of
contempt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a double right,&#8221; I said, in the same stubborn
tone, intending to anger her. &#8220;I saved your
life in the Gravenje hills and I came here now to
save you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, I did not think a man could be found
to speak thus at such a time,&#8221; she cried. She was
angry enough now even to forget for the moment
her grief.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are angry because I remind you of this, and
consequently do me the injustice of such a taunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard your words, sir,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t understand them. I spoke as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
did to rouse your anger and make you think of other
things beside your trouble, and having gained that
end, we&#8217;ll go back to where we began to speak of
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you? How dared you?&#8221; she wailed,
sinking back in her seat again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would do anything and dare anything to make
you think of yourself&mdash;even let you deem me as
mean a hound as my words implied. You must
face this thing resolutely. I have one thought that
may give us hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot think or speak of anything now. I&mdash;I
am sorry for my words just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t matter any. If you had thought or
said anything less, you wouldn&#8217;t have been yourself,
and I should have been disappointed in you. Now,
there&#8217;s one thing that may help us. Let me be able
to tell Colonel Petrosch when he comes that you renounce
all claims to the succession and consent to
leave Belgrade before nightfall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you have me run away in the hour of
danger from a crowd of dastardly assassins?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have you recognise facts as they are&mdash;that
the army have the upper hand, for the time at
any rate, and that they are resolved no member of
your family shall sit on the throne of this country.
I would have you save your life, Princess, by the
only means that I believe it can be saved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she cried, vehemently. &#8220;No one shall ever
say I ran away. That I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; I interposed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t take an oath about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
it. An oath is an awkward thing to break; but a
resolve one can argue against.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing shall persuade me to be such a coward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let us argue it out,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>But there was to be no chance of doing that; for
as I was speaking Colonel Petrosch and the Major
entered the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />


<small>&#8220;I CANNOT LEAVE MY COUNTRY.&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p>The black tragedy of the night had scored its mark
deep on Colonel Petrosch, and I shall not readily
forget the look of high-wrought strain which his
face wore. All the lines had deepened; the eyes
shone with unnatural brilliance, the sockets were
sunken, and the face skin had that dead steely colour
which comes after hours of fierce and passionate tension.</p>

<p>He looked as though he had lived ten years in as
many hours, and knew himself to be still confronted
by uncontrollable dangers full of the menace of utter
ruin and incalculable disaster.</p>

<p>Twice before I had seen such a look on men&#8217;s
faces. Once in the case of a reckless Westerner
who, in the teeth of warning, started a forest fire
only to see it spread with fierce violence down upon
his own homestead, menacing his wife and children
and all he had in the world, and barring the path of
rescue with a wall of impassable flame. The other
was a millionaire who, in a desperate plunge to
double his millions, was caught by the market, and
had to look on helplessly while he and his friends
were beggared in a day.</p>

<p>And I read Petrosch&#8217;s look now to mean that he
had helped to set in motion this wild revolt and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
shocked by the violence already done and appalled
by the prospect of what might yet have to follow.</p>

<p>I was glad to find it so. He might prove to be in
a better mood to judge on its merits the effort I had
made to save Gatrina. There had been enough
horrors already to glut his anger; and he looked
to the future with apprehension genuine enough to
render him willing to prevent the commission of
more.</p>

<p>He greeted Gatrina and me very formally, as he
and Major Kireef took their seats at the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have incurred a fearful responsibility, Mr.
Bergwyn,&#8221; he began. &#8220;Major Kireef has told me
the facts. You have taken an unwarrantable course
in attempting to thwart the army&#8217;s purpose, and
have used means which are inexcusable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were the only means I could find to use.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have compromised yourself and all with
you; you have opposed the soldiers when carrying
out the army&#8217;s orders, and have subjected them to
gross ill-treatment, in order that you might obtain
disguises for your purpose. And in doing this, you
have committed acts for which you must have known
you would have to answer. I can see neither excuse
nor palliation for such conduct.&#8221;</p>

<p>I made no reply to that tirade. I judged that he
had not taken the trouble to come at such a time
merely to lecture me on the heinousness of my conduct;
and as I cared nothing for what he said, and
only for what he meant to do, I let him talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;You yourself see there is no answer,&#8221; he continued;
and went on to condemn at considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span>
length with much detail the enormity of my offences,
until I began to be perplexed as to his motive. He
couldn&#8217;t have made the thing worse had he been
going to order my instant execution.</p>

<p>I guessed at length, however, that his real object
was to make me appreciate the extreme difficulty of
the task I had set him to get me out of the mess.
But the harangue had a very different effect upon
Gatrina. The blacker he made my conduct appear
and the more vividly he painted the danger in which
I stood, the greater was her manifest agitation; and
when he declared with very stern and significant
deliberation that at such times men had lost their
lives who had done less than I, I resolved to try and
stop him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will save time, Colonel Petrosch, if you are
going to order me to be shot, to have it done at
once,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I am not in the least ashamed of a
single thing I have done, except that I blundered
and failed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I understand you to mean, Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221;
he cried, very sternly, &#8220;that you would have me
report to my colleagues that in the face of all I have
said you take pride in having set their authority at
defiance?&#8221;</p>

<p>A hot retort rose to my lips, but just before it
passed, I caught his meaning and paused to consider
my reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t mean that. I recognise their authority
fully. In so far as my actions have involved an
apparent defiance of that authority, I must, of
course, regret them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span>&#8220;It would be impossible for the army to take any
but the sternest view of such acts, when committed
by one who is avowedly their enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know better than anyone in Belgrade
whether I am to be classed as an enemy, Colonel. I
am quite prepared to recognise their authority in the
country; although feeling nothing but the strongest
aversion from the hopeless deeds by which it has
been enforced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These are no concerns of yours, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except as they are the concerns of humanity. I
do not set up to be the judge of their acts: the world
will do that. I am a stranger and a foreigner, and
speak as one; no more. God send that the after consequences
may prove in some sort the justification
for what has been done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the prayer of us all,&#8221; he answered, very
solemnly, speaking out of that secret fear which possessed
him.</p>

<p>A pause followed which Gatrina broke to ask:
&#8220;Has any blood been shed beside that of the King
and Queen, Colonel Petrosch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Madam, I cannot speak of these matters with
you,&#8221; he replied, brusquely. &#8220;I came for other purposes&mdash;one
of them to find a way if I can to place
you out of&mdash;of the reach of harm.&#8221; His hesitation
over the last phrase was significant; but the declaration
gave me intense and unbounded satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will deal with your case first, Mr. Bergwyn.
May I take it that you regret your defiance of the
army, and are prepared now to submit yourself unconditionally
to their authority?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>&#8220;Unconditionally? What does that mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you will not again attempt to dispute it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am prepared to express my regret and to recognise
their authority.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the same thing,&#8221; he said. It was not, of
course, but I concluded he needed some kind of
assurance from me; and when I had given it, he conferred
in an undertone with Major Kireef. Then he
rose. &#8220;I must speak with you in private, Mr. Bergwyn;&#8221;
and he led me to another room.</p>

<p>As soon as we were alone he took my hand and
wrung it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have caused a great deal of trouble, but
personally I thank you for what you have done. I
believe you have saved the Princess&#8217;s life; and God
knows there have been too many taken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has occurred?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The King and Queen are dead; the Queen&#8217;s
brothers have been shot; several of the members of
the Government have also fallen; and the Princess
was to have shared the same fate, because of her
succession claims. But it may be possible to save
her now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possible only?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I used the term advisedly&mdash;possible. It must
depend upon the course of events to-day. Why did
you not prevail upon her to leave the country or at
least seek some place of safety?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget. You told me nothing of the imminence
of these horrors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I saw you I did not know myself. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
helped to raise the storm, but when once it broke it
was ungovernable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will happen to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can tell? The army holds the power; and
we believe from what we have already seen that the
people will stand behind us to a man. The city has
already broken out into rejoicings, and the soldiers
are cheered everywhere. But a mob is as fickle as
a summer breeze; and if a change comes over them,
nothing can save a conflict which may deluge the
city, aye, the whole country with blood. I am dazed
when I think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Princess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not answer even for your safety, Mr.
Bergwyn; nor even for my own; to say nothing of
hers. But I hope all will be well. The leaders of
the army have had their fill of horrors; and if the
day finds the people supporting them, this night will
have seen the last of these measures of despair. God
give that it may be so,&#8221; he cried with impressive
earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us get to details,&#8221; I said after a pause. I
was terribly anxious again. &#8220;What do you advise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you leave Belgrade at once for a time. Let
me carry an expression of your regret back with me,
and a pledge that the matter of the loan will be considered
as soon as the new Government is established.
You have acted in a way that, had you been
other than you are, the army would never have forgiven;
but when once the present fever is past, there
is no one who would think of dealing harshly with
the man who can render the assistance you can.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
But much must depend on what happens later to-day
when the facts about the night&#8217;s doings at the Palace
are published. Therefore I say, go for the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the men who were with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they known?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not. They were not arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then no inquiries will be made; but it would be
safer for them also to leave for a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now the great question&mdash;the Princess?&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and looked at me. &#8220;Would she leave
with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would she be allowed to leave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She would be allowed to escape,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;If she remains, she will be placed in confinement;
and if the army&#8217;s plans go right, she will be sent out
of the country. The Queen&#8217;s sisters have been
placed in similar confinement; and they too will be
liberated and exiled unless trouble comes. If that
happens, the Princess would be again in imminent
peril. She would be a menace to the only real
solution of the crisis&mdash;the change of dynasty. And
the army have given stern enough proofs of its resolve
in that matter. It has already decided upon
the future King&mdash;Peter Karageorgevics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I speak to her alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes! tell her what I have just said; and if you
have any influence with her use every shred of it to
prevail upon her to go. You will be doing not only
her a service but the country also. I will return in
an hour or so to learn the result.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she refuses to go?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span>He threw up his hands. &#8220;There will be only one
course open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arrest, yes; with all its possibilities.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went back then to Gatrina, and her eyes fastened
upon my face instantly, full of apprehensive questioning
anxiety. I looked probably as grave as I
felt; the Colonel&#8217;s last words having made me fully
alive to the vital issues which depended upon the
coming interview; and her anxiety deepened into
fear as I took my seat without speaking.</p>

<p>An orderly came in almost directly with a message
for the major, who went out, and then we two
were alone again.</p>

<p>&#8220;About yourself?&#8221; asked Gatrina, eagerly, as the
door closed behind them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no longer anything to fear. All that the
Colonel said was for the other man&#8217;s benefit, I think.
I am free to leave Belgrade when I will; and indeed
he urged me to do so at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad&mdash;so glad,&#8221; she answered, with a wan
smile and a sigh of relief. &#8220;He succeeded in frightening
me. I did not realise before he spoke so, all
you risked in this. I have been thinking while you
were with him, and I see it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there was ever any real risk of
trouble. I had his promise from the outset to do
all he could for me; and of course there were other
reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No risk, you say, after the conduct of that awful
man whom poor old Chris attacked?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, poor old dog. How we shall miss him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[391]</span>
Yet he could not have given his life for a better
cause. If we ever come back to Belgrade, I&#8217;ll have
a reckoning with that bully.&#8221;</p>

<p>She noticed that &#8220;we.&#8221; She glanced sharply at
me, and appeared as if to be going to speak of it, but
stopped. &#8220;What has occurred at the Palace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The news is about as black as it can be;&#8221; and I
told her all that Petrosch had said to me. I was
relieved to see that although she was deeply and
indeed intensely affected, her grief was less poignant
than before. Finding this, I dwelt with emphasis
upon the position of the Queen&#8217;s sisters; until she
understood my purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are speaking of what you think will be my
lot,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I don&#8217;t wish to alarm you, but I know
that that is what will be done&mdash;with this difference:
that if the opposition to the army takes any active
form, your danger will be greater even than theirs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one thinks that; and I should be the last to
think it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is my duty to remain at whatever risk.&#8221; She
was very firm, very dignified, very much the Princess
as she said this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish the Throne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean am I ambitious to rule? No, no,
a thousand times no. I am not fit for it. I am
more a woman than a Princess; but I cannot think
of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could think of yourself what would
you do?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span>&#8220;Why put idle questions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it altogether idle? As a woman, you are
barred from the succession by yourself. Even if
your claims were admitted, you would have to marry
someone who as your husband would be accepted by
the nation as King; but he, not you, would be the
ruler&mdash;even if the army were not bent upon changing
the dynasty and had not already chosen their
King.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Colonel Petrosch has told me;&#8221; and I repeated
the message he had authorised me to deliver.</p>

<p>&#8220;He told you to tell me that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, expressly and authoritatively.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that you should see quite clearly the
wisdom of adopting the course which will help the
army leaders and so serve the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that I should play coward and run
away. He set you to tempt me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it a temptation?&#8221;</p>

<p>She thought earnestly and then exclaimed; &#8220;I
cannot go. I cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not now &#8220;I will not;&#8221; and I was glad to
note the difference.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could think of yourself what would you
do?&#8221; I asked again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I answer as I did just now&mdash;why put that idle
question to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>I paused and then plunged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;I love you, Gatrina.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no; any answer but that; give any reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
but that,&#8221; she cried, as the red flushed into her
cheeks till they flamed, and she sank back in her seat
and hid them from me with her trembling hands.</p>

<p>I knelt by her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the truth, Gatrina; why should I not say it?
Once before our hearts spoke. You remember that
day on the hill at Samac. We knew it then; what
need to hide it now? It is all in all to me. What is
it to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, no,&#8221; she murmured hurriedly. She was
trembling violently. &#8220;It is impossible. It is impossible.
I told you then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what it is not now, whatever it may
have seemed then. It is true I am only a&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hsh!&#8221; Just a whisper and a hand laid impulsively
upon mine, and a glance of reproach from
tender, loving eyes.</p>

<p>I closed my hand on hers and held it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, only Bourgwan then,&#8221; I said, and she
smiled. &#8220;If you could think for yourself....&#8221; I
began again.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tempt me. You
make it so hard for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be as you decide,&#8221; I pleaded. &#8220;But the
world holds no other woman for me than you.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that she started, drew her hand away quickly,
and bit her lip. &#8220;I had forgotten,&#8221; she murmured.</p>

<p>I read her thought. It was of Elma&#8217;s lie. &#8220;In
that you did me grave wrong. I had no thought
but for you in coming here; and none in staying.
You might have trusted me after that day at Samac.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>&#8220;I did not mistrust you. I thought only of
your&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she hesitated in sudden embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let all be clear now between us, Gatrina. We
may never meet again or we may never part again&mdash;as
you decide it. The stake is too great for us to
risk it all for the lack of plain words. I know what
is in your thoughts; but on my honour it was never
for an instant in mine, and never could be. Do
believe that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you felt it would be impossible for us&mdash;oh,
it is so difficult.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then put your hand in mine again and I shall
know the slander is understood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is still impossible, Bourgwan,&#8221; she whispered.
&#8220;I am so sorry;&#8221; and as is in pity for the pain I
must feel she gave me her hand again.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you could think for yourself only?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God knows I would so gladly do as you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was sweet but yet sad hearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do wish it and do press it, not for my sake only
but for yours,&#8221; I urged.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot, Bourgwan; I cannot leave my country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is final?&#8221; I asked, looking into her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You make it so hard for me. I cannot. I
cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>I lifted her hand and pressed my lips to it. I had
failed; and with a heavy sigh rose and went back to
my seat, with a feeling of blank desolateness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have grieved you,&#8221; she said gently when I had
sat silent some while. &#8220;And you have done so much
for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that, please,&#8221; I interposed, forcing a smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[395]</span>&#8220;I can never forget it,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;We shall
not meet again, as you said; but I can never forget
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I ask one thing? If matters go with you
so that you should ever have to leave the country,
may I seek you again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all sad for you&mdash;and for me, too, you know
that&mdash;but it is kinder, if harder, not to give you
groundless hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never cease to hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never leave my country,&#8221; she answered,
earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am answered, but not convinced,&#8221; I replied, in
quite as earnest a tone as hers; and then, to lighten
the strain, I smiled and added: &#8220;If you will not
leave it, I may have to leave mine and turn Serb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have at least one loyal subject then, I
am sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the words left her lips, the door opened and
Colonel Petrosch returned.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />


<small>PETROSCH HAS A PLAN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>A single glance at Colonel Petrosch convinced me
that some change had taken place in the situation
during his absence which he considered favourable.
His step was less heavy; the air of oppressed anxiousness
was gone; his face had lost that depressed, care-haunted,
apprehensive look which I had seen before;
and his bearing was almost confident and bright.</p>

<p>He went at once to the matter in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to tell you you are free to leave, Mr.
Bergwyn,&#8221; he said, with obvious satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am deeply obliged to you for your intervention,
Colonel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shew it by leaving Belgrade by the first available
train and remaining away for some days at least
until matters have settled. Then we shall be ready
to receive you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have had news which you consider good?&#8221;
I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I think the best we could have. There is
now no room for reasonable doubt that the people
will not only support the army&#8217;s action, but will do
so with enthusiasm. The news is known everywhere
now, and reports from all over the city from all
classes are to this effect. Every minute brings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span>
added proof of this. It is an intense and consummate
relief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is consummate shame and scandal that murder
should be thus hailed with acclamation,&#8221; cried
Gatrina, indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those will be dangerous views to express to-day,
madam,&#8221; said Petrosch, turning to her. &#8220;You and
I must of necessity look upon this revolution with
very different feelings. What to you appears murder,
I and those with me regard as the only gate to
national liberty which was left open to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Bergwyn has told me that many murders
have been committed in the night. There will be
a heavy reckoning for each of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lives have been taken, it is true, because, as we
believe, no other course was left, if a violent revolution,
followed by the horrors of a civil war, was to be
avoided. Better for half a dozen lives to be taken
deliberately than as many thousands in a civil war.
What we have done we have done; and we leave the
issue to God. The future will judge whether we
have done right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cold blooded murder cannot be justified by an
appeal to the Almighty,&#8221; said Gatrina, indignantly.
&#8220;Who draws the sword himself shall feel the blade.
You may seem to be successful; the people may shout
for you and applaud you because you are strong; you
may for the time carry all before you with a powerful
hand; but by this fearsome appeal to blood you
have raised a force which will crush you in the end
with infinite disaster to the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Petrosch listened with pent brows, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
replied with impressive deliberation. &#8220;I am disturbed
to hear this from you, madam, and it compels
me to put to you a question which I beg you to
answer with due regard to the solemn consequences
which your words may have for yourself. Do I
understand you to mean that you yourself would
take part in any movement or plans which might be
made against the army and its decisions, and for the
restoration of your family upon the throne?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, indeed. God forbid that for any mere
personal ends either word or act of mine should ever
tend to plunge the country into the horrors of such
a conflict.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alarmed by his sudden change to severity, I was
greatly relieved to hear Gatrina&#8217;s words. So I think
was he. He looked across to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you told the Princess what I said to you
before, Mr. Bergwyn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but she does not see her way to leave the
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Voluntarily, you mean? But you cannot remain,
madam,&#8221; he said to her. &#8220;It is absolutely impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not leave, Colonel Petrosch.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sighed. &#8220;I regret exceedingly to hear that
unfortunate decision and trust you will recall it. I
am authorised to tell you that if you will sign a document
abandoning all claim to the succession and
leave the country voluntarily, your property and
fortune shall not be forfeit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall not change my decision for a bribe,
Colonel Petrosch,&#8221; she answered instantly and
proudly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[399]</span>&#8220;It is not meant as a bribe; but your presence
will be an embarrassment to the new Government,
and in any case you must go. Must: it is imperative.
Pray think, then, before you set the Government
at defiance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have given my decision, and nothing will alter
it, Colonel Petrosch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is your last word?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On that point, my last word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I regret it deeply. I have now no option but to
tell you that you will be a prisoner. I can, at any
rate for the present, spare you the harassment of
being removed from your own house. But the
house is in possession of our troops and I must ask
you to remain in your own apartments, pending our
decision in regard to your movements.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall make no attempt to run away,&#8221; said
Gatrina, getting up as she spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; I broke in. &#8220;I should like to put a
question or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Petrosch turned upon me an inscrutable look and
replied with a shew of sternness: &#8220;You can do nothing
to influence our decision in such a matter, Mr.
Bergwyn. The Princess has refused our offer. That
is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; I answered, bluntly. &#8220;Are we
to understand that the Princess is in any danger
from the acts of your agents? We have seen already
what some of them are capable of doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to be able to give an assurance that
ample precautions will be taken for the Princess&#8217;s
personal safety during the few hours she will remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
here. If you will take counsel from me, madam, I
would urge you to lose no time in preparing for your
departure. We shall decide very quickly. I will
now call the guard;&#8221; and he left the room.</p>

<p>I turned to Gatrina and impulsively she put both
her hands in mine and lifted her face and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; she murmured, her lips quivering.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you could have done as he asked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could&mdash;for your sake; but ...&#8221; she
shook her head. &#8220;You have done so much for me.
I can see your hand in all this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give it up, Gatrina, for my sake,&#8221; I cried, passionately,
the love in me breaking all bounds. &#8220;You
would trust yourself to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, gladly, if I could but be a coward. I
should be a happy coward, Bourgwan; but....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot lose you. My God, I will not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, please be strong enough for us both. I
am so weak when I think of you: of all that I am
losing. But&mdash;I must stay. You know that in your
heart. I must be true to my duty. For Heaven&#8217;s
sake help to save me from my weakness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot lose you,&#8221; I cried again.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. Leave it me to think of you as always
doing the right thing. I want my memory of you
undimmed. It must be good-bye. It must.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot say it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no other word to say, Bourgwan. No
other word. Do you know how hard you are making
this for me?&#8221; she added gently after a pause.</p>

<p>I caught her and held her passionately.</p>

<p>&#8220;You love me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>Again she raised her face, now close to mine, and
gazed into my eyes frankly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I did not, should I care?&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>Slowly I bent my head till my lips touched hers,
and as they met she yielded to me and kissed me in
return, and then let her head rest on my shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how you make me wish I were a coward,&#8221;
she murmured. &#8220;It is harder than ever; but it must
be good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gently she drew away and put her hands in mine
as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must never meet again, Bourgwan,&#8221; she
said, with one of her sweet smiles. &#8220;You tempt me
so. I could not trust myself again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God keep you, Gatrina. Good-bye;&#8221; and I
pressed my lips to her hand and then led her to the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is even harder than the day at Samac,&#8221; she
whispered, smiling again; and with those words and
a last long look she passed out, and I was alone in
the room&mdash;alone for always.</p>

<p>I was staring desolately out into the garden when
Colonel Petrosch came back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought perhaps you might wish to say a word
or two to the Princess, Mr. Bergwyn; and now I
want to speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; what is it?&#8221; I answered, indifferently. Nothing
mattered now. What he said or didn&#8217;t say
was all one to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to ask you for your confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About the&mdash;the Princess.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span>&#8220;Except to know that she will be safe, I would
rather not speak of her,&#8221; I answered, abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard the story that you met her when
you were in the Bosnian hills under circumstances....&#8221;</p>

<p>But I wasn&#8217;t having that and cut him short pretty
brusquely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should regard any question on such a subject
as verging upon impertinence, Colonel Petrosch.
Please ask none.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled. &#8220;That is very much like confirmation.
You must not lose your temper with me. I
am an old man, you a young one, and I want to help
you. If the Princess had been other than....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop right there, if you please,&#8221; I cried, angrily.</p>

<p>But he only smiled. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll put it another
way. The Princess is a very obstinate young woman
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Princess has decided rightly, Colonel
Petrosch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the result of her decision is that in a few
hours she will be sorely in need of a friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I speak plainly what&#8217;s in my mind&mdash;what
was in it when I went out of the room just now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; I returned after a pause. &#8220;Have I been a
fool?&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not answer that question in direct terms;
but he spoke very plainly, and what he said answered
it indirectly. We had a brief but very pithy conversation;
and at the end of it I got up and shook
his hand effusively and &#8220;God blessed him,&#8221; bade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span>
him good-bye, and scampered off to my house more
like a school-boy than a man of many cares, and with
no longer any thought of the prospect of desolate
loneliness which had appeared to threaten me so
gloomily only a few minutes before.</p>

<p>As I passed through the streets there were already
abundant signs of the popular feeling. Early though
the hour was, flags were flying, decorations being
hurriedly prepared, men and women were abroad
gaily dressed, and everyone getting ready to join
in what was clearly to be a public holiday.</p>

<p>Death and terror had had their grim reign in the
frowning gloom of the night; but the scene had
shifted with the daylight. The Army were hailed as
the deliverers of the people; the tragic means were
condoned for the sake of the end attained; and on
all sides the people were making haste to parade the
evidences of satisfaction at the change and gratitude
to those who had wrought it.</p>

<p>How much of the demonstration was genuine,
how far it was wire-pulled, or to what extent it was
dictated by that prudence which impels the crowd
to side with the strongest I did not stop to think.
It was enough that the city would side with the
Army and that its leaders would therefore go on
with their work undisturbed by fears of turbulence
and resistance. That meant much to me just then.</p>

<p>I found my servants vastly uneasy at my absence
during the night. Even the placid Buller was excited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God you have come, sir. We dursen&#8217;t go
to bed. We didn&#8217;t know what to think or do.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>&#8220;I daresay you didn&#8217;t, but get a hustle on you
now and pack up. I&#8217;m leaving in a couple of hours
and want my light baggage with me. Pick out
enough for a few days; and express all the heavy
trunks to Vienna.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God, sir,&#8221; he exclaimed, fervently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, get going then&mdash;you&#8217;ll have time for
thanksgiving on the cars,&#8221; I said, as he hesitated.
&#8220;And tell someone to get me some breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>I dashed into my bedroom, had a bath and
changed out of Nikolitch&#8217;s uniform&mdash;which was a
good deal the worse for the night&#8217;s wear&mdash;had my
breakfast, establishing probably an American record
for eating speed, and sat down to knock off the
cables and letters which my hurried departure necessitated.</p>

<p>I was deep in one to Nikolitch explaining things
and telling him I had made all excuses for him with
Petrosch, when Karasch arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly hoped to find you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must shelve all that, Karasch,&#8221; I interposed.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to leave the city with me in
less than an hour from now; and see here, take
money to pay those men liberally for what they did
last night and tell them they&#8217;d better hold their
tongues and skip for a while. You must be at the
depot in an hour ready to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask a question now. All has gone right.
Be off with you,&#8221; and I got up and opened the door
to hustle him off. As I did so, Elma was in the hall,
and Buller was protesting that I could not receive
her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>At sight of me she pushed past him and came into
my room. She was as full of agitation as a setting
hen over her first chick; and when she saw from my
face that I was in high spirits her astonishment was
boundless.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m leaving,&#8221; I said, pithily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Running away?&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about the size of it. Can I do anything
for you in Vienna?&#8221; I had no anger left for her, or
indeed for anyone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have heard the news?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About the murders last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to run away while she is in
danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; she repeated with a scoff. &#8220;Gatrina, I
mean, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that she&#8217;s in any particular peril.
I called there last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you speak so lightly as that? She
must be saved at any cost. I&#8217;ve come to offer to help
you save her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Death,&#8221; she said, with tragic earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can one do? The army is all powerful. I
must think of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good God, are you such a coward?&#8221;</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders. &#8220;A man must think
of his own life. I&#8217;ve no fancy to risk mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face was a study in contempt. &#8220;You mean
you will not attempt to save her?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>&#8220;I tell you I&#8217;m bolting. I don&#8217;t suppose her fate
will be anything very terrible, and perhaps after all
she deserves it. Anyway, I shall not think of opposing
the army in the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew her breath quickly and looked at me
with almost fierce disdain. &#8220;You coward! Oh,
you coward,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it isn&#8217;t very brave. But then I never
set up for a hero.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if I tell you that I know her death has been
decided upon and that if you will help, we can save
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t make any difference to me. You see
I&#8217;m packed up, and even my train is chosen. I
simply can&#8217;t stop. Besides, I expect you&#8217;ve been
misinformed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you I know it,&#8221; she cried, fiercely, as if
seeking to rouse me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m afraid the bottom will be knocked out
of your marriage scheme in regard to her. Still, I
daresay you&#8217;ll hatch another.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the limit. She fell back a pace, stared at
me aghast, and then broke out into a violent tirade
of denunciation and abuse of my cowardice and generally
contemptible conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, let me say half a dozen plain words,
Baroness,&#8221; I replied, when she paused for lack of
breath. &#8220;During the last days I have been here
you have done your utmost against me; every
weapon you could find you have used without
scruple to try and ruin me. You failed every time;
and now you come with some other plan in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span>
subtle and beautiful head of yours to try and lure
me into a last net. For the time I came very near
to fearing you; I don&#8217;t like saying ugly things to a
woman; and I&#8217;ll just content myself with the confession
that I no longer fear anything you can do, and
pay no heed whatever to anything you can say.
That&#8217;s all. And now, as I&#8217;m busy getting ready to
run away, as you call it, I must ask you to excuse
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have some other scheme?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can put it that I&#8217;m running away; and leave
it at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not polite, to say the least of it.&#8221; I rang
the bell. &#8220;Buller, have you packed up yet?&#8221; I
asked when he came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And directed that the heavy luggage is expressed
through to Vienna?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the carriage?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. It will be at the door in a quarter of
an hour, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do. You hear that?&#8221; I asked Elma.</p>

<p>She made a gesture of angry impatience. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
understand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means good-bye, Baroness. I have still some
letters to finish and arrangements to complete, and
have, as you hear, only fifteen minutes. I part without
any anger;&#8221; and I held out my hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will save Gatrina without you,&#8221; she exclaimed,
not taking my hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anyone can do that, but it&#8217;s very
good of you to try,&#8221; I replied with a conventional
smile.</p>

<p>This appeared to kindle all her rage again to white
heat. She stared at me a moment, then raised her
arms above her head and with a passionate ejaculation
of disgust, swept out of the room.</p>

<p>Her complete mystification and indignant wrath
gave me intense satisfaction, and with a chuckle of
enjoyment I sat down again and finished my letters
just in time to drive hurriedly to the depot and catch
my train.</p>

<p>But I did not take tickets for Vienna, for that was
not my destination.</p>

<small>THE CAMP AGAIN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p>Buller&#8217;s patience and respectful stolidity were
sorely strained that day. In the first place I told
him nothing about our destination; and when we
made several changes during the journey only to
alight at the exceedingly unpromising depot at
Samac in the afternoon, his manner began to afford
me genuine amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do we wait here long for the train, sir?&#8221; he
asked, as if the sooner we were off again the better.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only until Karasch can get a carriage or some
horses, Buller. I suppose you can ride, by the by?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; that is&mdash;oh, yes, sir&mdash;a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Karasch got four horses after some difficulty but
no carriage; one to carry my valises. They were
four rank bad animals; but they carried us to Poabja,
albeit with much discomfort for Buller. But his disgust
appeared to reach a climax when he saw the
little inn and I told him it was our hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, sir?&#8221; he exclaimed incredulously, with a
very wry face.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have some excellent black bread there,
Buller, and the water is as fine as any in the district.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he replied mechanically, as he got off
his horse awkwardly. He was very stiff and discomfited.
&#8220;Beg pardon, sir, but do we stay long here?&#8221;
he asked, dejectedly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>&#8220;Not more than a month or two&mdash;till we start to
rough it in the hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>He groaned and his face fell so that I laughed, and
to hide it dismounted and told him to go into the
house and make such arrangements as he could for
our accommodation, without mentioning my name.
&#8220;Be very guarded, Buller, for much hangs upon
your discretion, and I don&#8217;t want our lives to be imperilled
by any loose talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I walked away up the narrow hilly street,
whistling. I was in such spirits that I could not
resist the temptation of playing this small joke upon
my superlatively proper and decorous servant. In
my humour, the veriest trifle set me smiling, the
minutest detail of life in the little place interested
me.</p>

<p>The children came out to stare at me and I scattered
some small coins among them and brought
them about me in a scrambling, laughing, boisterous
crowd. Some of the men recognised me; and I
stopped now and again to exchange a word or two
with them and gave them money. The whole of the
little street was full of smiling faces and I had such
a body guard when I reached Father Michel&#8217;s cottage,
that the good priest came out in some surprise
to learn the cause of the clatter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I need your protection again, father,&#8221; I cried
cheerily; &#8220;but from a different sort of crowd this
time. Let me come in and talk to you, and send
these young brigands away. They take <i>me</i> for the
witch this time with a power to coin money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I bid you welcome, sir,&#8221; he said gravely as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span>
bade the youngsters run home and led me indoors.</p>

<p>I was closeted with him for an hour or more, telling
him many things which vastly surprised him,
gaining his help for the purpose I had in view, preparing
him for what was coming, and binding him
to secresy until the time arrived for all to be explained.</p>

<p>When I got back to the inn Karasch, as the result
of my instructions had a carriage ready, and Buller
looking very glum and very much out of his element
was standing by a saddle horse for me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go on, Karasch, I shall overtake you,&#8221;
I said, and he drove off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I not to go, sir?&#8221; asked Buller, nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Buller, thank you. You stay here. And
mind, don&#8217;t get quarrelling; these people are very
good-natured, but very handy with the knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, sir, but how long am I to stay here
alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not frightened, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I hope not, sir, but if anything&#8217;s likely to
happen&mdash;to you, sir, I mean I&#8217;d like to know of it,
in case I could help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve done you some injustice, Buller, and
I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221; I was pleased by his words. &#8220;Nothing
will happen&mdash;nothing dangerous that is. All is as
right as it could be. I&#8217;ve come here for a special
purpose; and we shall all be away to-morrow or very
soon after, for Vienna I expect. All you need do is&mdash;to
amuse yourself for an hour or two. If you go
out, walk down the hill and not up; I don&#8217;t want you
to be seen up that way. I shall be back soon after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>
dark; and you can hunt around and get me the best
thing in the way of dinner you can contrive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; he said in a tone of obvious
relief; and stepped back, as I mounted and rode after
Karasch on the road back to the station at Samac.</p>

<p>&#8220;All you&#8217;ve got to be careful about, Karasch,&#8221; I
told him when we reached there; &#8220;is not to let your
face be seen. It&#8217;s quite dark, so there&#8217;s very little
risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>I tethered my horse out of sight and walked up
the little hill where Gatrina and I had had our talk
that day, and waited there, thinking of her and of
much that had passed since we had parted there,
and she had sent poor old Chris back to me. The
picture was very vivid in my thoughts; her retreating
figure on the winding path, and the old dog coming
slowly up the path toward me and turning to
look after her; when the reverie was broken by the
noise of the coming train, and I hurried down the
hill back to the station.</p>

<p>I found a spot where I could get close enough to
observe what occurred without being seen.</p>

<p>The last car was a saloon from which three men in
the uniform of officers alighted. One of them turned
and helped out a lady, a somewhat portly person
who appeared to be stiff and cramped with a long
journey. Then without assistance another lady
stepped out and looked about her as if recognising
the place.</p>

<p>All five passed through the station house, and one
of the men spoke to Karasch, who murmured some
reply and touched his hat. Four of them entered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
carriage and the fifth got up by Karasch who then
drove off.</p>

<p>The station master and his assistants stood looking
after the carriage and gossipping with three
peasants and a woman, the only other passengers by
the train; and were still discussing the possible
meaning of the unusual event as I mounted and rode
away.</p>

<p>I kept well behind but I was near enough to the
carriage when it reached the priest&#8217;s house to see
him come out, exchange a few words with the
officers, and then lead someone into the house.
He returned and spoke again to the officers, all three
of whom entered the carriage which passed me
directly afterwards on the return to Samac.</p>

<p>I rode on to the inn, and having an hour to wait, I
filled up the time by changing my clothes and eating
the dinner which Buller had had prepared. I was
in a condition of intense nervous excitement, and
kept glancing at my watch wishing the time to pass,
impatient of the delay. I was intensely absorbed by
the thought of what was to follow, and yet curiously
conscious of Buller&#8217;s consequential pride at having
provided so good a meal under such circumstances
and profound disappointment at my failure to be
impressed by his cleverness.</p>

<p>At last the time was up and I started for the
priest&#8217;s house, followed by a look of blank dismay
from Buller because I left before his chief dish was
served. I was half way up the street when the
reason of his look flashed upon me, and I burst out
laughing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[414]</span>Someone was waiting for me in the priest&#8217;s garden
and fetched him immediately.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is very sad and depressed, but she asked to
be brought to me, it seems. She is in there;&#8221; and
he pointed to a door which stood ajar.</p>

<p>I pushed it open and entered.</p>

<p>She was sitting with her back to the door in a
very dejected attitude, and thinking it was Father
Michel who had returned, she did not look round,
but said, as I closed the door:</p>

<p>&#8220;You have many calls on your time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been pretty busy during the last
week,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>She jumped up at the sound of my voice and
turned to me a face pale for a fleeting second and
then flushing with the glory of rich, deep crimson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bourgwan!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mademoiselle, Bourgwan, no other;&#8221; and
I stretched my hands to her.</p>

<p>She held hers back and tried to look indignant.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must blame Petrosch. He&#8217;s the villain of
the piece.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite her efforts her eyes smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a conspiracy, then,&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about the size of it. They&#8217;ve been pretty
plentiful lately, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had no idea....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was the conspiracy, of course,&#8221; I broke
in. &#8220;He&#8217;s a subtle villain, Petrosch. I was a mere
child in his hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smile was spreading very fast all over her face
now.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>&#8220;I ought to be very angry,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s broken up all my plans shamefully.
Instead of being in Vienna on my way back to the
States, here I am, just Bourgwan again, and you&#8217;re
just Mademoiselle. And goodness knows now what&#8217;s
going to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>We both laughed then and she no longer held
back her hands. I held them instead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand yet in the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see it was like this. I thought you
would rather that Father Michel than any other
priest should&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bourgwan!&#8221; she cried, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that right?&#8221; I asked, with an air of innocence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that Colonel Petrosch....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;s a dreadful scoundrel to guess things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know that I am a beggar and an exile?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed. He told me all about it; and I was
awfully glad. There&#8217;s another country over seas
which will be glad to adopt you. It&#8217;s a free country,
too; with a home in it where we shan&#8217;t be quite beggars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bourgwan! I told you it was impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I told you that we&#8217;re forgetting how to spell
that word in the States; although I came near learning
it in Belgrade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&mdash;I have nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, you have. You can draw a bill on the
bank of my affection and I&#8217;ll honour it right now&mdash;to
any amount.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You make a jest of it,&#8221; she said, now between
laughter and tears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t you think they made things serious
enough for us in Belgrade? What you&#8217;ve got to do
is just to forget all that, and to laugh and be glad&mdash;if
you are glad; and then to&mdash;well, there <i>is</i> something
else to do;&#8221; and I looked grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very serious thing, very serious, indeed.
But I think I ought to tell you, and I think you
ought to do it if your laughter is to ring true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you in earnest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, quite. Did you know that when we were
here before there was a man very badly wounded&mdash;desperately,
in fact. I was speaking to Father
Michel to-day about it and I told him I was sure
you would not like to have such a thing on your
conscience without doing all you could to help him.
That was right, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Was it that struggle in the street
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, the man doesn&#8217;t belong to Poabja; but he
was here to-day. The poor fellow will never get
over the wound. And he blames you, and feels that
you alone can save him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wound? Blames me? What can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bourgwan!&#8221; she cried, changing on the instant
from puzzled pity to laughing confusion; and then&mdash;well,
no matter what then.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards we sat down together and had a
good, square talk which did not end until she had
agreed that we had better consult Father Michel
about the details.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span>I was a happier man than ever when, after a very
informal little ceremony in Father Michel&#8217;s quaint,
crude church very early in the morning, we started
to indulge a mutual wish to have a last look at the
camp which had been so much to us.</p>

<p>What a ride that was! What memories it roused!
How delighted was Gatrina with everything! And
in what spirits! How we chattered and laughed, and
laughed and chattered, forgetting for the time, selfishly
if you will in our own happiness, the gloom
and tragedy from which we had just emerged. The
world appeared all bright and glorious for us, and
care and trouble far away.</p>

<p>Karasch was with us, of course; solemn, reserved
and taciturn as ever; but breaking into a sort of
grim smile whenever Gatrina spoke to him to point
out some bit of the road where some incident of that
other ride had occurred.</p>

<p>Buller I packed off to Samac to go by rail and
meet us afterwards at a place to which we could get
the train from Tuzla on the other side of the camp.
He did not belong to our hill comradeship and
would have been in the way.</p>

<p>We were careful to have a guide this time; and
how we laughed now when he told us we must have
come at least ten or fifteen miles out of our way during
that comradeship ride of ours by the compass.
We could laugh at anything.</p>

<p>We turned aside to visit the hill where we had
slept on the morning after the check by the two
rivers, and Gatrina recognised with a positive relish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>
the spot where she had washed on the brink of the
stream.</p>

<p>And when at last we came near the long, stiff hill
in the middle of which was the ravine leading to the
camp, her excitement and pleasure were greater
than ever. We chattered just like two glad children,
first about the incidents of her flight and
rescue, and then about that little contest of wills we
had had the following morning, and indeed about
every incident of the time at the camp.</p>

<p>Then came the camp itself, and Gatrina&#8217;s unbounded
surprise that already men were there getting
ready for the mining work. I told her what I
had done in Vienna and that in the superintendent
we might look to find our old enemy, Captain
Hanske, the Austrian official with whom we had
taken such rough liberties that memorable night.</p>

<p>We could stay but an hour there if we were to
reach Tuzla before nightfall, the guide told us; and
Gatrina and I spent the first few minutes in the little
hut which she had occupied.</p>

<p>It was a place full of mingled reminiscences for
us; and while we were there our thoughts slipped
back to the moment when, as I knew and my sweet
wife now confessed, we had fallen in love.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I knew it first,&#8221; she said, with a winsome
blush, &#8220;when we came back here alone after that
trial of will, Bourgwan. You were very obstinate;
but I&mdash;I&mdash;I won&#8217;t tell you any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it before that; when you stood at bay
against those scoundrels out on the hills there. But
you must have thought me an awful scarecrow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span>&#8220;I did think you were a peasant, when I knew you
were not a brigand. And when I found out my mistake,
I could have bitten out my tongue for the way I
had spoken to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a brigand. I stole your heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up with a bright, merry smile and was
about to answer when some noise and confusion outside
startled her.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite realistic&mdash;like it used to be. We&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

<p>We went out and I laughed aloud at what we saw.
Karasch had been seized by a couple of men who
were leading him towards us while the little Austrian
ex-official, now the superintendent, was abusing
him volubly and with almost frantic gesticulations.</p>

<p>He was a sharp fellow and the instant his eyes fell
on us he recognised us, and calling some more men
from the tent, he ran toward me shouting, &#8220;Here&#8217;s
the other man. So we meet at last, eh? And you,
too?&#8221; he cried to Gatrina, who was inclined to be
frightened and held my arm tight.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have good eyes and a keen memory for
faces, Captain Hanske. I congratulate you. We
only met in the dark and I see you recognise us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you admit it, you admit it, do you?&#8221; he said,
very excitedly. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ll shew you what it is to
assault me, and I&#8217;ll know who you are and all about
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t the least doubt about that. But don&#8217;t
be excited. I am Mr. Bergwyn, the American, associated
with Graf von Hartstein of Vienna in working
the mines here. I told him how I had treated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span>
you that night and as a recompense had you appointed
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>His jaw dropped as he gazed at me in amazement.</p>

<p>The silence was broken by a laugh, deep, raucous
and loud, from Karasch&mdash;the only loud laugh I ever
heard from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, superintendent,&#8221; I added. &#8220;I can
understand your bewilderment and your mistake.
Tell me how the work promises. Let Karasch there
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Bergwyn,&#8221; he stammered, &#8220;I am&mdash;I don&#8217;t
know what to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then don&#8217;t try. We&#8217;ve had enough of it. Just
show the things.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was a very humble and bewildered superintendent
then, and so ashamed that Gatrina spoke to
him to try and put him at his ease while he shewed
us about the place until the guide sent word that we
must start.</p>

<p>We were standing in the tent then and were alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is where you had the fight with Karasch,
Bourgwan, and his arm was broken, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, when Chris, the other member of the comradeship
was on guard with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear old Chris,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I am so sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something else happened here beside that fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You told me just now when you think you&mdash;knew.
Well, it was here I first hoped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoped?&#8221; she cried, her face wrinkling and her
eyes questioning.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[421]</span>&#8220;Yes, hoped. You remember I lay here after
that blow on the head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there;&#8221; and she pointed to the very spot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone watched by me here, when I was unconscious.&#8221;</p>

<p>She began to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean Chris?&#8221; she asked with an air of unconcern.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I mean I wasn&#8217;t unconscious quite so long
as you thought and you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bourgwan! The guide says we must go,&#8221; she
cried quickly, with a lovely blush.</p>

<p>&#8220;And when you did, I began to hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We mustn&#8217;t keep him any longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he could wait while you&mdash;do it again.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she laughed and tossed her head and walked
out of the tent.</p>

<p>As we crossed to the horses, she said: &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know what you must have thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you might do it again so I remained
unconscious.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I put her on her horse, she whispered: &#8220;I was
going to, but Karasch came;&#8221; and then shook the
reins and started.</p>

<p>I caught her up a moment afterwards and by a
mutual impulse we turned and had a last look. It
was a wild, meagre, rough, dirty and abominably
squalid place&mdash;but very dear to us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, old comradeship camp,&#8221; said Gatrina,
smiling, with a tear in close attendance, I think. &#8220;It
might be lovelier,&#8221; she added, &#8220;but it couldn&#8217;t be
dearer in my thoughts.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span>&#8220;Nor in mine&mdash;for it gave me you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And me my Bourgwan&mdash;I may well love it.&#8221;</p>

<p>We sat on the horses just gazing back, both heart
full, until the silence was broken by a shout from the
now impatient guide; and we wheeled about and
hurried after him.</p>

<p class="ph2">Good Fiction Worth Reading.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A series of romances containing several of the old favorites in the field
of historical fiction, replete with powerful romances of love and diplomacy
that excel in thrilling and absorbing interest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>WINDSOR CASTLE.</b> A Historical Romance of the Reign of Henry VIII.,
Catharine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>


<p>&#8220;Windsor Castle&#8221; is the story of Henry VIII., Catharine, and Anne
Boleyn. &#8220;Bluff King Hal,&#8221; although a well-loved monarch, was none too
good a one in many ways. Of all his selfishness and unwarrantable acts,
none was more discreditable than his divorce from Catharine, and his marriage
to the beautiful Anne Boleyn. The King&#8217;s love was as brief as it
was vehement. Jane Seymour, waiting maid on the Queen, attracted him,
and Anne Boleyn was forced to the block to make room for her successor.
This romance is one of extreme interest to all readers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>HORSESHOE ROBINSON.</b> A tale of the Tory Ascendency in South Carolina
in 1780. By John P. Kennedy. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J.
Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>Among the old favorites in the field of what is known as historical fiction,
there are none which appeal to a larger number of Americans than
Horseshoe Robinson, and this because it is the only story which depicts
with fidelity to the facts the heroic efforts of the colonists in South Carolina
to defend their homes against the brutal oppression of the British
under such leaders as Cornwallis and Tarleton.</p>

<p>The reader is charmed with the story of love which forms the thread
of the tale, and then impressed with the wealth of detail concerning those
times. The picture of the manifold sufferings of the people, is never overdrawn,
but painted faithfully and honestly by one who spared neither
time nor labor in his efforts to present in this charming love story all that
price in blood and tears which the Carolinians paid as their share in the
winning of the republic.</p>

<p>Take it all in all, &#8220;Horseshoe Robinson&#8221; is a work which should be
found on every book-shelf, not only because it is a most entertaining
story, but because of the wealth of valuable information concerning the
colonists which it contains. That it has been brought out once more, well
illustrated, is something which will give pleasure to thousands who have
long desired an opportunity to read the story again, and to the many who
have tried vainly in these latter days to procure a copy that they might
read it for the first time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>THE PEARL OF ORR&#8217;S ISLAND.</b> A story of the Coast of Maine. By
Harriet Beecher Stowe. Cloth, 12mo. Illustrated. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>Written prior to 1862, the &#8220;Pearl of Orr&#8217;s Island&#8221; is ever new; a book
filled with delicate fancies, such as seemingly array themselves anew each
time one reads them. One sees the &#8220;sea like an unbroken mirror all
around the pine-girt, lonely shores of Orr&#8217;s Island,&#8221; and straightway
comes &#8220;the heavy, hollow moan of the surf on the beach, like the wild
angry howl of some savage animal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Who can read of the beginning of that sweet life, named Mara, which
came into this world under the very shadow of the Death angel&#8217;s wings,
without having an intense desire to know how the premature bud blossomed?
Again and again one lingers over the descriptions of the character
of that baby boy Moses, who came through the tempest, amid the
angry billows, pillowed on his dead mother&#8217;s breast.</p>

<p>There is no more faithful portrayal of New England life than that
which Mrs. Stowe gives in &#8220;The Pearl of Orr&#8217;s Island.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><b>DARNLEY.</b> A Romance of the times of Henry VIII. and Cardinal Wolsey.
By G. P. R. James. Cloth, 12mo, with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis.
Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>In point of publication, &#8220;Darnley&#8221; is that work by Mr. James which
follows &#8220;Richelieu,&#8221; and, if rumor can be credited, it was owing to the advice
and insistence of our own Washington Irving that we are indebted
primarily for the story, the young author questioning whether he could
properly paint the difference in the characters of the two great cardinals.
And it is not surprising that James should have hesitated; he had been
eminently successful in giving to the world the portrait of Richelieu as a
man, and by attempting a similar task with Wolsey as the theme, was
much like tempting fortune. Irving insisted that &#8220;Darnley&#8221; came naturally
in sequence, and this opinion being supported by Sir Walter Scott,
the author set about the work.</p>

<p>As a historical romance &#8220;Darnley&#8221; is a book that can be taken up
pleasurably again and again, for there is about it that subtle charm which
those who are strangers to the works of G. P. R. James have claimed was
only to be imparted by Dumas.</p>

<p>If there was nothing more about the work to attract especial attention,
the account of the meeting of the kings on the historic &#8220;field of the cloth of
gold&#8221; would entitle the story to the most favorable consideration of every
reader.</p>

<p>There is really but little pure romance in this story, for the author has
taken care to imagine love passages only between those whom history has
credited with having entertained the tender passion one for another, and
he succeeds in making such lovers as all the world must love.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>CAPTAIN BRAND, OF THE SCHOONER CENTIPEDE.</b> By Lieut.
Henry A. Wise, U. S. N. (Harry Gringo). Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations
by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>


<p>The re-publication of this story will please those lovers of sea yarns
who delight in so much of the salty flavor of the ocean as can come through
the medium of a printed page, for never has a story of the sea and those
&#8220;who go down in ships&#8221; been written by one more familiar with the scenes
depicted.</p>

<p>The one book of this gifted author which is best remembered, and which
will be read with pleasure for many years to come, is &#8220;Captain Brand,&#8221;
who, as the author states on his title page, was a &#8220;pirate of eminence in
the West Indies.&#8221; As a sea story pure and simple, &#8220;Captain Brand&#8221; has
never been excelled, and as a story of piratical life, told without the usual
embellishments of blood and thunder, it has no equal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>NICK OF THE WOODS.</b> A story of the Early Settlers of Kentucky. By
Robert Montgomery Bird. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>


<p>This most popular novel and thrilling story of early frontier life in
Kentucky was originally published in the year 1837. The novel, long out of
print, had in its day a phenomenal sale, for its realistic presentation of
Indian and frontier life in the early days of settlement in the South, narrated
in the tale with all the art of a practiced writer. A very charming
love romance runs through the story. This new and tasteful edition of
&#8220;Nick of the Woods&#8221; will be certain to make many new admirers for
this enchanting story from Dr. Bird&#8217;s clever and versatile pen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>A COLONIAL FREE-LANCE.</b> A story of American Colonial Times. By
Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>


<p>A book that appeals to Americans as a vivid picture of Revolutionary
scenes. The story is a strong one, a thrilling one. It causes the true
American to flush with excitement, to devour chapter after chapter, until
the eyes smart, and it fairly smokes with patriotism. The love story is a
singularly charming idyl.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>THE TOWER OF LONDON.</b> A Historical Romance of the Times of Lady
Jane Grey and Mary Tudor. By Wm. Harrison Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with
four illustrations by George Cruikshank. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>This romance of the &#8220;Tower of London&#8221; depicts the Tower as palace,
prison and fortress, with many historical associations. The era is the
middle of the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>The story is divided into two parts, one dealing with Lady Jane Grey,
and the other with Mary Tudor as Queen, introducing other notable characters
of the era. Throughout the story holds the interest of the reader.
In the midst of intrigue and conspiracy, extending considerably over a
half a century.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING.</b> A Romance of the American Revolution.
By Chauncey C. Hotchkiss. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>


<p>Mr. Hotchkiss has etched in burning words a story of Yankee bravery,
and true love that thrills from beginning to end, with the spirit of the
Revolution. The heart beats quickly, and we feel ourselves taking a
part in the exciting scenes described. His whole story is so absorbing
that you will sit up far into the night to finish it. As a love romance
it is charming.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>GARTHOWEN.</b> A story of a Welsh Homestead. By Allen Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>


<p>&#8220;This is a little idyl of humble life and enduring love, laid bare before
us, very real and pure, which in its telling shows us some strong points of
Welsh character&mdash;the pride, the hasty temper, the quick dying out of wrath....
We call this a well-written story, interesting alike through its
romance and its glimpses into another life than ours. A delightful and
clever picture of Welsh village life. The result is excellent.&#8221;&mdash;Detroit Free
Press.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>MIFANWY.</b> The story of a Welsh Singer. By Allan Raine. Cloth,
12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>


<p>&#8220;This is a love story, simple, tender and pretty as one would care to
read. The action throughout is brisk and pleasing; the characters, it is apparent
at once, are as true to life as though the author had known them
all personally. Simple in all its situations, the story is worked up in that
touching and quaint strain which never grows wearisome, no matter how
often the lights and shadows of love are introduced. It rings true, and
does not tax the imagination.&#8221;&mdash;Boston Herald.</p>

<p><b>GUY FAWKES.</b> A Romance of the Gunpowder Treason. By Wm. Harrison
Ainsworth. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by George Cruikshank.
Price, $1.00.</p>


<p>The &#8220;Gunpowder Plot&#8221; was a modest attempt to blow up Parliament,
the King and his Counsellors. James of Scotland, then King of England,
was weak-minded and extravagant. He hit upon the efficient scheme of
extorting money from the people by imposing taxes on the Catholics. In
their natural resentment to this extortion, a handful of bold spirits concluded
to overthrow the government. Finally the plotters were arrested,
and the King put to torture Guy Fawkes and the other prisoners with
royal vigor. A very intense love story runs through the entire romance.</p>

<p><b>THE SPIRIT OF THE BORDER.</b> A Romance of the Early Settlers in the
Ohio Valley. By Zane Grey. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson
Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>


<p>A book rather out of the ordinary is this &#8220;Spirit of the Border.&#8221; The
main thread of the story has to do with the work of the Moravian missionaries
in the Ohio Valley. Incidentally the reader is given details of the
frontier life of those hardy pioneers who broke the wilderness for the planting
of this great nation. Chief among these, as a matter of course, is
Lewis Wetzel, one of the most peculiar, and at the same time the most
admirable of all the brave men who spent their lives battling with the
savage foe, that others might dwell in comparative security.</p>

<p>Details of the establishment and destruction of the Moravian &#8220;Village
of Peace&#8221; are given at some length, and with minute description. The
efforts to Christianize the Indians are described as they never have been
before, and the author has depicted the characters of the leaders of the
several Indian tribes with great care, which of itself will be of interest to
the student.</p>

<p>By no means least among the charms of the story are the vivid word-pictures
of the thrilling adventures, and the intense paintings of the beauties
of nature, as seen in the almost unbroken forests.</p>

<p>It is the spirit of the frontier which is described, and one can by it,
perhaps, the better understand why men, and women, too, willingly braved
every privation and danger that the westward progress of the star of empire
might be the more certain and rapid. A love story, simple and tender,
runs through the book.</p>

<p><b>RICHELIEU.</b> A tale of France In the reign of King Louis XIII. By G. P.
E. James. Cloth, 12mo. with four illustrations by J. Watson Davis. Price, $1.00.</p>



<p>In 1829 Mr. James published his first romance, &#8220;Richelieu,&#8221; and was
recognized at once as one of the masters of the craft.</p>

<p>In this book he laid the story during those later days of the great cardinal&#8217;s
life, when his power was beginning to wane, but while it was
yet sufficiently strong to permit now and then of volcanic outbursts which
overwhelmed foes and carried friends to the topmost wave of prosperity.
One of the most striking portions of the story is that of Cinq Mar&#8217;s conspiracy;
the method of conducting criminal cases, and the political trickery
resorted to by royal favorites, affording a better insight into the statecraft
of that day than can be had even by an exhaustive study of history.
It is a powerful romance of love and diplomacy, and in point of thrilling
and absorbing interest has never been excelled.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
